       "      <td>willingness of the general public to comply with protective public health measures in the event of pandemic infl uenza is necessary for success in disease response and containment. in addition, better estimates of population compliance with such measures is valuable when assessing their contributions in the mathematical modeling of pandemics and in estimating the effectiveness of pandemic control decisions and policies; both in terms of disease containment and cost. a recent systematic review of physical interventions to reduce the spread of respiratory diseases 1 has clearly demonstrated the signifi cant contribution of simple low-cost interventions, such as mask-wearing and hand washing. data in this review, from severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars)-related studies, indicated that mask-wearing reduced risk of spread by 68%; a fi gure that increased to 91% if n95 masks were worn. review of the australian management plan for pandemic infl uenza 2 and the nsw state health action plan 3 suggests that the need for the general population to wear face masks is likely to be a key component in ensuring continuity of essential services (eg, public needing to wear face masks in health care settings), and in supporting societal functioning (eg, people wearing face masks on public transport or when in common public areas such as shops/malls). where possible, the continuation of daily activities is likely to be important for population mental health as well as commercial and economic resilience. vaccination has been identifi ed in the australian plan and by the world health organization (who) as a potential strategy in the early response to pandemic infl uenza, and hence, population willingness to receive vaccination is an important factor for consideration. state pandemic vaccination plans promote use of pneumococcal vaccination and inter-pandemic (or seasonal) infl uenza vaccine for priority and at-risk groups, and the who has recommended seasonal infl uenza vaccinations for health care workers to reduce risks of genetic shifts in the avian infl uenza virus and to minimize \"background noise\" in the event of an outbreak. 4 pandemicstrain vaccination may take a number of months to supply in suffi cient quantities for population-level vaccination, however, if there was suffi cient lag in the global spread of infl uenza to australia a widespread mass vaccination of the population could become a key preventative national strategy. willingness to go into isolation or quarantine (either voluntarily or compulsorily) may also become a requirement of the containment strategy at state and national levels. a number of studies relating to public compliance with protective health behaviors have been published in recent years; including either reported levels of compliance during the outbreaks of sars and h5n1/avian infl uenza, or in anticipation of an h5n1/avian infl uenza pandemic. studies relating to behavior during or around sars outbreaks in hong kong indicated that during sars more than 90% of hong kong residents frequently wore face masks. 5, 6 following sars it was reported that 71% would wear face masks if there was a resurgence of sars. 6 however, research in singapore during sars found that only 4% of respondents in a representative population sample had worn a face mask in the preceding three days. 7 sars-related research from toronto, canada focused on compulsory quarantine and voluntary quarantine/isolation, mostly in health care workers rather than in the general population. 8, 9 compliance with compulsory quarantine was reported as high. 9 in population research fear of job/income loss was one of the most common reasons for noncompliance or for not self-quarantining. 8 in addition, the importance of good social support (friends/family) was identifi ed, due to high reliance on others for groceries and routine supplies; a need which the government was unable to meet. studies of anticipated general population compliance with protective behaviors have been undertaken in hong kong, 10, 11 norway, 12 italy, 13 the usa, 14 and, comparatively, across a number of european and asian countries. 15 in the small usa study 14 82% of participants reported that they would wear a face mask to protect others if they caught avian fl u, 78% would accept quarantine, and 84% reported that they would want vaccine to protect them from avian fl u if it were available. in the comparative europe/asia study, 15 45%-52% would limit contact with family and friends, and 24%-35% would stay indoors. in hong kong 73.8% of respondents reported that they would wear a mask in public venues and 88.3% reported that they would be fully compliant with any quarantine policies. 10 factors infl uencing uptake of protective behaviors were reported in many studies of sars, and avian infl uenza, with increased compliance often being associated with higher risk perception and anxiety, 16 concern for self/family/children, 10, 16 perceived susceptibility, 17, 18 greater knowledge regarding transmission, 13 and perceived effectiveness of protective measures. 10 with regard to demographic factors, increased adherence to protective behaviors is often associated with older age groups, female gender, higher levels of education, 10, 16 and being in full time employment. 10 studies specifi cally concerning willingness to receive vaccination in the event of a future outbreak of h5n1/avian infl uenza or in relation to sars have not been found in australia or other countries not previously affected by sars or h5n1, however, australian data relating to population willingness to receive seasonal infl uenza exists, and suggests that for those in infl uenza risk groups (over 65s, and 40s-64s meeting established research council (nh&amp;mrc) 'at risk' criteria) infl uenza vaccination uptake is infl uenced by perceptions of risk, self rated health status and beliefs about the effi cacy of the vaccination. 19 data from hong kong indicate that rates of seasonal infl uenza vaccination have increased since sars and h5n1 and vaccination uptake behavior was linked to higher perceived likelihood of a large local outbreak of h5n1 in the future and perceptions that any future outbreak would be worse than sars had been. 17 the purpose of the current study was to gather the fi rst baseline australian data on public levels of willingness to comply with vaccination, isolation, and face mask wearing in the event of an infl uenza pandemic in australia, and to assess a selection of sociodemographic, health, and threat perception factors that might infl uence such decisions. a short six item pandemic infl uenza question module was developed, as the fi rst part of a larger module of questions on potential threats. these questions were fi eld tested, validated and subsequently administered within the nsw population health survey, using the nsw health survey program cati anticipated public health compliance for pandemic infl uenza system, between january 22nd and march 31st, 2007. the nsw population health survey includes questions on health behaviors, health status (including psychological distress, using the kessler 10 measure, 20 and self-rated health status), access to health services, as well as the demographics of the respondents and the households. the target sample was persons living in nsw stratifi ed by the state's eight area health services. households were contacted using random digit dialing. details of the sampling approach can be found in the 2007 nsw health survey report. 21 the pandemic infl uenza question module comprised three questions addressing pandemic infl uenza threat perception and three questions addressing willingness to comply with requested protective health behaviors. the latter questions are the subject of this paper, and their wording was as follows: \"in case of an emergency situation, government authorities might request co-operation from the public in a number of ways. please indicate …\" 1. how willing would you be to receive vaccination? 2. how willing would you be to isolate yourself from others if needed? 3. how willing would you be to wear a face mask? all responses were coded on a fi ve-point likert-scale. response options for all questions were 'not at all willing,' 'a little willing,' 'moderately willing,' 'very willing,' and 'extremely willing'. in addition, 'don't know' and 'refused' responses were coded. the remaining pandemic infl uenza questions on threat perception included a question on how likely respondents thought it was that there would be an infl uenza pandemic in australia, how concerned they would be that they or their family would be affected by such a pandemic, and whether they had made changes to their life because of the possibility of an infl uenza pandemic. prevalence data for these questions has been reported by barr and colleagues. 22 in this study, the threat perception questions were used as independent variables in the analysis to assess whether aspects of threat perception infl uenced anticipated compliance. the survey data were weighted to adjust for probability of selection and for differing response rates among males and females and different age groups. 21 data analysis was performed using the \"svy\" commands of stata version 9.2 (stata corp, college station, tx, usa), which allowed for adjustments for sampling weights. the fi ve-point likert-scale response used in the question module were dichotomized, such that responses of very/ extremely willing (high willingness) were coded as 1 and all other responses as 0. in addition a composite 'all' measure was calculated in which data from respondents who indicated that they would be very/extremely willing to comply with all three behaviors had their response coded as 1 and those with willingness to comply with two or fewer behaviors were coded as 0. this enabled identifi cation and analysis of a group in the sample that reported high universal willingness to comply. to assess the factors that infl uence willingness to comply with protective health behaviors, the dichotomized compliance question indicators and the 'all' indicator were used as outcome measures and these were investigated using the following set of independent variables: gender; age; marital status; have children; location (urban/rural) as defi ned by respondents' area health region; born in australia; speak a language other than english at home; living alone; employed; highest level of formal education; household income; self-rated health status; psychological distress (as determined by the kessler k10 measure, which is a composite measure with a range of 10-50 in which 'high psychological distress' has been categorized as a score ? 22 and 'low psychological distress' as a score ͻ 22); 20 and the three pandemic infl uenza threat questions (concern for self/family, pandemic likely, and life changes). multiple survey logistic regression using a stepwise backwards model was used in order to identify the factors signifi cantly associated with willingness to comply with health protective behaviors. all variables with statistical signifi cance of p յ 0.05 were retained in the fi nal model. in total 2081 state residents aged 16 and over completed the module on pandemic infl uenza. the overall response rate was 65%. the key demographics of the weighted survey were comparable to australian bureau of statistics (abs) 2006 australian population census data. 22 overall 73% of the population indicated that they would be very or extremely willing to receive vaccination, 67% would be very/extremely willing to isolate from others if needed, 58% would be very/extremely willing to wear a face mask, and 48% would be very/extremely willing to do all three. less than 8% of the population reported being 'not at all' willing to wear a face mask, and considerably lower proportions of the population were 'not at all' willing to comply with vaccination (3%) and isolation (5%). tables 1a-d present results of the survey logistic regression modeling, showing the unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio (or) for the associations between the three health protective behavior questions and the composite (all) indicator. the infl uence of age on willingness to comply with protective behaviors was found to be a key variable, and this effect is illustrated in figure 1 . generally, people reported high levels of willingness to comply with health protective behaviors in the event of pandemic infl uenza; with two thirds of the population reporting that they would be very/extremely willing to receive vaccination, two thirds reporting that they would be very/extremely willing to isolate if needed, and more than half reporting that they would be very/extremely willing to wear a face mask. although these indications of high willingness to comply may appear lower than expected, from other research studies, it should be noted that these data were collected at a time when pandemic infl uenza was not regarded as a high threat by australians; only 14% of the nsw population reported that they felt pandemic infl uenza was very or extremely likely to occur. evidence from other countries, as well as our multivariate analysis, suggest that general compliance with these behaviors would increase substantially if general concern increased, 16 although other factors, such as access to face mask, social responsibility and social acceptance, perceived effectiveness, and communication strategies would also contribute. multivariate analysis of the data indicated that the factors associated with high willingness to comply varied with each behavior, although generally, those reporting higher levels of concern that they or their families would be affected by pandemic infl uenza and those with higher levels of formal education were more likely to report high willingness to comply, and those who were younger (especially in the 16-24 year old age group) were generally less likely to report high willingness to comply. the relative importance of these factors in public health measure compliance is consistent with the fi ndings of others 10, 16 and provides helpful information to support those involved with risk communication and public health education. addressing individual behaviors, and in addition to the factors associated with high willingness to comply noted above, those with children and those with higher incomes were likely to report high willingness to receive vaccination. factors associated with lower levels of willingness to isolate oneself were speaking a language other than english at home, being younger and having never been married. these fi ndings are potentially important for those involved in disease or emergency response, and with further research to identify reasons for this lack of willingness to isolate, may suggest a need for tailored communication or support strategies. it is possible that these groups rely more on social contact outside of the household and, hence, would be less willing to forfeit this in the event of a pandemic. indications in the data show that immigrants (those not born in australia) and those who speak a language other than english at home may be less willing to isolate themselves. response to mask wearing was associated with the general factors of age, education, and concern for self/ family. however, it is the only behaviour studied here that is also associated with respondents' perceived likelihood of pandemic infl uenza occurring. mask wearing, overall, is the behavior that people reported being least willing to comply with and it is possible that, for this reason, higher threat perception (concern and likelihood of pandemic) is required to drive compliance with this behavior. younger people (16-24 and 25-34) are generally less willing to wear face masks, and only those with university qualifi cations or equivalent are signifi cantly more likely to be willing to wear face masks. in the event of a pandemic it is likely that the public will be required to wear masks, especially in health care facilities, in public places, and in situations where individuals need to interface with the public, eg, certain critical occupations such as banking, welfare, post/delivery, fuel service, and shops. the mediating effect of increased threat perception in the event of actual pandemic is likely to raise compliance but data suggest that certain sectors of the general population are likely to remain resistant to mask wearing and require further encouragement, communication strategies, and education. our analysis indicates a number of signifi cant differences between the levels of willingness to comply by respondents in differing marital status categories; most notably that those in the never married category report lower levels of willingness to comply. it should be noted, however, that there is a strong interaction with age, such that 52% of the never married category are in the 16-24 age range (76% in [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] and therefore indications of lower willingness to comply may more simply be related to age than marital status. similarly, 73% of those in the widowed category are in the 65+ age ranges. anticipated public health compliance for pandemic infl uenza worthy of mention are those factors included in the study and analysis that were not associated with willingness to comply with protective behaviors. no statistically signifi cant effects were found for gender, those living alone, employment, or psychological distress. gender and employment status have been identifi ed as determinants of health protective behaviors in some studies, 10,16 but were not found to be signifi cant here. concern for self and family, has proven to be a signifi cant factor associated with willingness to comply with protective health behaviors. this fi nding suggests that the concomitant concern/risk that would come with an actual pandemic might be suffi cient to increase public health compliance to required levels, as noted in data from hong kong during sars. 18 an alternative, more active approach might include the use of risk communication messages before a pandemic occurs, or in the pre-pandemic/increased alert stages. although the adoption of such an approach might seem compelling, middaugh in a recent paper 23 warns about the unintended consequences of raising concern over 'frightening' the public about germs, increasing concern about seasonal infl uenza (to increase take-up of vaccination) and emphasizing the role of social distancing. he argues that such approaches cause societal estrangement and frighten health care workers, fi rst responders, and those who would have contact with the public in the event of a pandemic. finally, consideration should be given to the limitations of the current study. the main limitation is that the questions are based on a hypothetical, anticipated threat to an infl uenza pandemic-naive population and, hence, serve as only a general indication of the likely response of the public to such an event. in addition, the analysis has focused on the use of dichotomized responses and has not included those who were less willing, but still may have complied with the behaviors investigated in the study. as noted, reported willingness to comply with these behaviors is likely to be mediated by a number of factors, and it is probable that only a subset of these have been identifi ed in this study. the role of threat perception, anxiety, societal response (the compliance of others), media, and factors directly related to the course of the pandemic are all likely to infl uence public response. data from this study provide the fi rst australian population baseline in this area against which future response can be tracked and pandemic modeling can be informed. this study collected data regarding anticipated responses to an infl uenza pandemic and although in the event of an actual pandemic the infl uence of age on willingness to comply with health protective behaviors. percentage shown is the proportion 'very'/'extremely' willing to comply. the overall level of compliance is likely to be infl uenced by a range of factors, it is probable that relative compliance levels within the data would be upheld and would be more robust for use in pandemic planning.</td>\n",

       "      <td>during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) outbreak, traditional intervention measures such as quarantine and border control were found to be useful in containing the outbreak. we used laboratory verified sars case data and the detailed quarantine data in taiwan, where over 150,000 people were quarantined during the 2003 outbreak, to formulate a mathematical model which incorporates level a quarantine (of potentially exposed contacts of suspected sars patients) and level b quarantine (of travelers arriving at borders from sars affected areas) implemented in taiwan during the outbreak. we obtain the average case fatality ratio and the daily quarantine rate for the taiwan outbreak. model simulations is utilized to show that level a quarantine prevented approximately 461 additional sars cases and 62 additional deaths, while the effect of level b quarantine was comparatively minor, yielding only around 5% reduction of cases and deaths. the combined impact of the two levels of quarantine had reduced the case number and deaths by almost a half. the results demonstrate how modeling can be useful in qualitative evaluation of the impact of traditional intervention measures for newly emerging infectious diseases outbreak when there is inadequate information on the characteristics and clinical features of the new disease-measures which could become particularly important with the looming threat of global flu pandemic possibly caused by a novel mutating flu strain, including that of avian variety. r</td>\n",
       "      <td>in order to contain the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) outbreak in 2003, the government in taiwan implemented numerous measures of intervention and control (kaydos-daniels et al., 2004; lee et al., 2003; twu et al., 2003) . prominent among which is the level a quarantine, implemented on march 17, for all possible contacts of suspected sars cases which eventually reached a total of 55,632 individuals quarantined, and level b quarantine, implemented on april 28, of all travelers arriving at borders from affected areas which totaled 95,828 (see table 1 in hsieh et al., 2005) . other intervention measures implemented during the outbreak include temperature monitoring, sars fever hotline, hand washing, restricted access to all medical facilities, fever screening at designated local hospitals, as well as mandatory face mask wearing while in hospitals, public transportation, and other enclosed public places, most of which were also implemented on april 28, the day after the first sars fatality had occurred in taiwan. mathematical modeling has also pinpointed the turning point of sars infections in taiwan to april 28 . it is generally acknowledged that intervention measures such as isolation of symptomatic cases and the quarantine of their traced contacts had been instrumental in controlling the past sars outbreak (chau and yip, 2003; diamond, 2003; enserink, 2003; ou et al., 2003; pang et al., 2003) . a recent modeling study (fraser et al., 2004) suggests that sars, along with smallpox, is easier to control using these simple public health measures than hiv and influenza. however, due to the current lack of evidence regarding infectivity of sars-cov prior to onset, quarantine for sars did not seem to directly prevent infections during the incubation period in the traditional sense. indeed, it has been demonstrated that quarantine served as a screening process for sars whereby previous quarantined persons who showed onset of symptoms can be more swiftly diagnosed and sufficiently isolated once onset of symptoms occurs (hsieh et al., 2005) . in view of this rather indirect effect of quarantine in preventing infections, it is important to know precisely what role did an extensive quarantine measure such as the one implemented in taiwan actually played in the eventual containment of the outbreak (ho and su, 2004) . moreover, the value of border screening and level b quarantine in deterring travel by ill persons and building public confidence remains unquantified up to now (bell, 2004) . (zhang et al., 2005) used a continuous-time compartmental model to study the impact of quarantine for sars in china. in this article we propose to use discrete time model to ascertain retrospectively and qualitatively the impact of level a and b quarantine measures in taiwan by making use of the laboratory confirmed sars case data in taiwan. the quarantine data used in this work were obtained and cleaned from the original case data in taiwan center for disease control (tcdc) sars databank (see table 1 in hsieh et al., 2005 for a summary). the sars case data contains the clinical data from onset to discharge or death and the quarantine status of 480 confirmed sars cases in taiwan, including 346 sars cases that were officially confirmed by tcdc and additional 134 laboratory confirmed sars-cov (ab+) individuals who either had milder symptoms but were not clinically diagnosed as probable cases at the time of the outbreak, or probable cases who were previously ruled-out due to false negative pcr or ab test results. these 134 cases were identified from a subsequent tcdc-sponsored large-scale seroepidemiological follow-up study to search for previously undiscovered sars cases (hsieh et al., 2005) . all seropositive cases from this study were confirmed by two different serological tests to detect anti-sars-cov antibody once discrepancies occurred. the ongoing laboratory test results of these newly laboratory confirmed cases are updated as of november of 2004. the resulting percentages of all level a and b quarantined persons who had been confirmed as sars-cov(+) cases are, respectively, 0.041% and 0.001%. the quarantine status of imported cases is given in table 1 . of the 346 officially confirmed cases in taiwan, 336 have complete clinical records from onset to discharge or death. in addition, 125 of the 134 laboratory confirmed sars-cov(+) cases have complete clinical history from onset to discharge or death. we will use the case data of these 461 (336+125) confirmed cases with time of onsets between february 25 and june 25 for our modeling study (see fig. 1 ). note that one suicide case was also excluded from the case data used. we consider a susceptible-infective-removal (sir) model (flow diagram in fig. 2 ) similar to the linear model in , but with additional compartments for levels a and b quarantined persons (respective variables a n and b n ), and for the previously quarantined infectives (j n ). hospitalized cases (h n ) mean those who were diagnosed and hospitalized as a suspected sars case, while the probable cases (p n ) are ones who has been classified as a probable sars case according to the case definition of (world health organization, 2003a). note that the subscript n has been deleted in fig. 2 for brevity. the detailed model description is given as follows: model variables: s n the number of susceptible individuals at time t ¼ n a n the number of level a quarantined infected persons at time t ¼ n b n the number of level b quarantined infected persons at time t ¼ n i n the number of infective (symptomatic) sars cases at time t ¼ n not previously quarantined j n the number of previously quarantined infective (symptomatic) sars cases at time t ¼ n h n the number of hospitalized suspected cases at time t ¼ n p n the number of probable cases at time t ¼ n r n the cumulative number of discharged sars cases at time t ¼ n d n the cumulative number of sars deaths at time t ¼ n c 1 (n) number of imported cases not quarantined when entering at time t ¼ n c 2 (n) number of imported cases quarantined when entering at time t ¼ n note that time unit is in days. (1) the number of imported susceptible persons and birth during the outbreak are small compared to the total susceptible population (s). (2) a person is moved out of susceptible class only after onset of symptoms and/or quarantine. (3) an infective person can infect others at either infective (i and j) or hospitalized (h) stages. (4) a hospitalized case is removed either by reclassification to probable sars case or death. (5) a probable case is removed either by discharge or death. q quarantined rate of infected persons g j , j ¼ 1, 2 onset rate of levels a and b quarantined persons, respectively m j , j ¼ 1, 2 hospitalization rate of unquarantined and previously quarantined infective cases, respectively o rate of reclassification to probable cases s discharge rate of probable sars persons r 1 fatality rate of hospitalized sars cases r 2 fatality rate of probable sars cases l n incidence rate at time n b constant infection rate due to contact with an infective case (i) g constant infection rate due to contact with a hospitalized case (h) z constant infection rate due to contact with a previous quarantined infective case (j) the model equations with time unit in day then follows: note that we use a simple linear model instead of a nonlinear model with standard incidence or mass action since, in a small outbreak like sars in 2003, the total susceptible population remained relatively unchanged. also note that, theoretically, it is conceivable for q to be greater than 1 in a hypothetical scenario of highly efficient contact tracing and quarantine program. however, our aim is to study 2003 sars outbreak retrospectively where we knew the quarantine was much less efficient in reality. the parameter estimation for the model was carried out by fitting the time series of 361 confirmed sars case data to the model using three-stage least-squares (3sls) method, commonly used in econometrics for estimating multiple parameters of simultaneous equations (pindyck and rubinfeld, 1998) . the detailed description of the 3sls estimation procedure is given in the appendix. to simplify the estimation, we will make use of previously published estimates of the model parameters for taiwan sars, whenever available. in hsieh et al. (2005) , the mean onsetto-diagnosis times for quarantined and unquarantined individuals were computed from the taiwan sars case data to be 1.20 days and 2.89 days, respectively, hence we obtain m 2 ¼ 1/1.2 ¼ 0.833 and m 1 ¼ 1/2.89 ¼ 0.346 for the respective removal rates of the quarantine and unquarantined infective. moreover, also from the result in hsieh et al. (2005), we can obtain o ¼ 1/7.55 ¼ 0.132 for the reclassification rate of the hospitalized persons. the estimates for the model parameters are given in table 2 along with their respective p-values for the t-tests used to determine whether each parameter is significantly different from zero (statistical details relating to p-values obtained here are also given in the supplementary information). the infections by the previously quarantined persons j n and hospitalized patients h n (g and z) were determined by the model to be not significantly different from zero when compared with the infection during infective stages i n and hence omitted from table 2 . we proceed to describe the important epidemiological parameters and results which we can deduce from the estimation. from the estimates we are able to obtain the average case fatality ratio for a sars probable case conditional on death or recovery which is given by the simple formula: where r 2 is the fatality of a probable case and d is the discharge rate. that is, given that a probable case has only two possible outcomes of recovery or death, the chance of fatality is approximately one in nine, which is lower than the cumulative case fatality ratios (deaths/case number) reported in affected regions (table 3 , world health organization, 2003b). the average daily quarantine rate for level a quarantine is estimated to be q ¼ 0.047 [95%ci: 0.0280-0.0677], which is the average rate at which potential candidates for quarantine (i.e. the asymptomatic exposed persons) on any particular day are in fact being quarantined. in other words, during this period one out of every 21 asymptomatic individuals who should be quarantined was indeed quarantined. moreover, it is not significantly the weighted r-square for the estimation is r 2 ¼ 0.9983. a p-value of 1àm 1 +b(1àq). b p-value of qb. different from the overall quarantine rate of 0.05 (24 quarantined cases out of 480 total cases). we can further make use of the results to explore the effectiveness of the quarantine implemented. for illustration, we let the quarantine rate for level a quarantine q vary between 0 and 1, where q ¼ 0 means no quarantine and q ¼ 1 implies swift quarantine of locally exposed persons, i.e. everyone potentially exposed and should be quarantined on any particular day is being quarantined 24 h after exposure, on the average. we then compute the theoretical numbers of sars cases and deaths using the model and designated value of q. table 3 gives the resulting percentage of increase or reduction in the total numbers of sars cases and deaths. the result indicates that the level a quarantine for sars in taiwan with 0.047 quarantine rate (which yields theoretical numbers of 569 cases and 99 deaths) had prevented approximately 461 cases (81%) and 62 deaths (63%), while a swift quarantine of q ¼ 1, where everyone locally exposed and should be quarantined was quarantined on the first day, would have reduced both the case number and fatality by over 86%, or only 68 totally cases and 14 deaths. note that in this theoretical scenario, the case number of 68 includes 35 imported cases, of which only one had been quarantined on arrival. subsequently, local transmission by these unquarantined imported cases after onset contributes to the additional cases. moreover, infective cases with minimum incubation time of 1 day (onset within 1 day of exposure) had been reported in china as well as singapore (world health organization, 2003b), further leading to the possibility of local transmission by these locally infected cases before quarantine. only q-n implies quarantine for every locally exposed individual immediately after exposure, which would prevent all cases except those 35 imported cases mentioned above and their first level infecteds of those unquarantined on arrival. we proceed in similar fashion with regard to level b quarantine by computing the theoretical increase in the numbers of sars cases and deaths if the single quarantined imported case had not been quarantined, as well the reductions if the unquarantined imported cases had been quarantined. table 4 gives the results of this theoretical study. first we study the impact of one imported case who arrived from china on may 2 via sea but was not quarantined even though, starting on april 28, full-scale quarantine of all border arrivals from china were required to be home quarantined for 14 days. failure to quarantine this individual, who had onset of symptoms on may 7 and was diagnosed and hospitalized the next day, resulted in approximately 12 cases and 2 death (row 1). moreover, if level b quarantine had been implemented from the beginning of the outbreak and all imported cases were successfully quarantined at the border, it would result in 49% reduction in cases and in sars fatality (row 2). there were only two successful quarantined (level b) imported cases, both arriving from china. the first was quarantined on arrival on march 28, developed symptoms on april 1 and was diagnosed as suspected case and table 3 theoretical impact of level a quarantine on case number and fatality with various hypothetical quarantine rates q as compared with quarantine rate of q ¼ 0.047 estimated from the model the percentage increase or reduction is given in parenthesis. + denotes additional cases, à denotes reduction in cases. the percentage increase or reduction from theoretical numbers of cases or death using the present model is given in parenthesis. + denotes additional cases, à denotes reduction in cases. quarantined on april 2. our simulation shows that if this successful quarantine of this imported case had not occurred, it would result in approximately 17 cases and three deaths (row 3). the second quarantined imported case was quarantined on arrival on may 6, had onset of symptoms on may 8 and was diagnosed and hospitalized immediately. quarantine of this case prevented approximately 12 additional cases and two death (row 4). quarantine of the earlier case is only slightly more impactful. the combined effect of these two quarantined cases prevented 29 cases and five deaths (row 5). the combined effect of all quarantines reduced the case number and fatality almost by half (last row). (1) in a fast spreading infectious disease with unknown or uncertain knowledge of the etiological agent, the effectiveness and efficiency of control efforts are of the highest priority. the quarantine rate q gives a measure of the efficiency, or the speed, at which a potential level a quarantine case is actually being quarantined. thus quarantine rate of 0.047 estimated over the time period 2/25-6/25 indicates that, on a daily basis, only one out of every 21 exposed persons who should be quarantined was actually quarantined. this reflects the need for more efficient real-time contact tracing during the outbreak in order to seek out potential infected persons for quarantine, observation, and swift diagnosis when onset of symptoms occurs. one should note, however, that the data used includes many mild cases that were not clinically diagnosed and hence their exposed contacts were not traceable. this would result in a significantly lower quarantine rate than the one computed from using clinically diagnosed sars cases only. hence the efficiency of contact tracing and quarantine is also dependent on correct diagnosis of symptomatic infective individuals, which could be severely lacking in the early stages of a newly emerging disease such as witnessed during the past sars outbreak. (2) the contribution to infections by the previously quarantined (j n ) and hospitalized (h n ) persons appeared to be insignificant when compared with the infection by the infectives in i n . this does not mean infections by j n and h n had not occurred, merely that their effects were relatively insignificant. in fact, 80% of the officially confirmed sars cases in taiwan were acquired in hospitals (ho and su, 2004) , but the many of them occurred prior to the patients' hospitalization as a suspected sars case, while they were in outpatient clinics, observation rooms, and emergency rooms, sometimes for other illness, where the patients often stayed for hours and sometimes for days before being moved (jiang et al., 2003a, b) . many of those infected were also in the hospital as healthcare workers, hospital staff, and visitors. this also indicates that, in term of intervention, rapid initial detection is much more important than subsequent classification of probable cases. (3) by comparison, a perfect level a quarantine (which aimed to quarantine all asymptomatic cases as soon as they were potentially exposed) results in more drastic reduction of cases than a perfect level b quarantine. however, it is intuitive that if all imported cases were effectively isolated, there would be no local outbreak. indeed, from our result the timeliness of level b quarantine is important, as indicated by the difference in the reduction of cases by the two quarantined imported cases. given the controversial nature of fullscaled quarantine of international travelers, appropriate mathematical modeling is required to provide evidence-based criterion for public health authority to determine its swift implementation. the difficulty and scope involved in a successful quarantine, as quantified in tables 3 and 4 , gives strong indication that quarantine must be combined with other intervention measures for successful and swift containment of an outbreak. the results also corroborate with previous studies of intervention measures for sars outbreak where hospital-wide case isolation is found to be more important than quarantine (see e.g., day et al., 2006; gumel et al., 2004; lloyd-smith et al., 2003; webb et al., 2004) . (4) the simulation results in tables 3 and 4 highlight the effect an efficient quarantine measure could have on significantly reducing the magnitude of the outbreak. we emphasize, however, that the numbers of reduction and increase in cases and deaths shown in tables 3 and  4 are not to be taken literally, but to be consider qualitatively as a measure of the magnitude of the effect brought on by the various hypothetical scenarios for the purpose of comparing different control measures. however, there is ample evidence that superspreading events had played a significant role in the 2003 outbreaks (li et al., 2004; riley et al., 2003) which was not singled out in our model. (5) finally, the effect of public response to outbreak and behavior change to prevent infection is most difficult to quantify. question remains as to how one can pinpoint the degree of effectiveness or the relative importance of different measures implemented. one may never know for certain how important temperature monitoring or hand washing had been to the containment of the outbreak, or what role, if any, did mandatory face mask wearing in public transportation systems play, or whether the decrease in infection rate is merely due to the psychological effect of outbreak and the subsequent behavior change by the general population to simply try to stay home and avoid contacts-especially since multiple prevention measures were co-operating at the same time in blocking all possible channels of the transmission of sars-cov. one thing is certain, all of these intervention measures and the subsequent in-dividual behavior changes combined to prevent the past sars epidemic from being more catastrophic than it was, and will be our best defense when the next emerging infectious disease approaches. yhh and cck are supported by national science council of taiwan (grants nsc 93-2751-b005-001-y and nsc 93-2751-b002-020-y). yhh would like to thank mitacs (canada) for their generous financial support for yhh to attend the mitacs sars meetings at banff, canada, where several of the above-mentioned discussions took place. the authors thank three anonymous referees for constructive comments which helped to improve this manuscript significantly. the authors also would like to extend our sincere gratitude to public health personnel at tcdc and local health departments for their dedicated efforts in the prevention and control measures during 2003 sars outbreak. appendix. parameter estimation procedure to estimate the model parameters, we treat a linear system of equations a multi-equation simulation model, which allows us to account for the interrelationship within a set of variables, namely, a n , b n , j n , i n , h n , p n , and d n , which are called endogenous variables in econometrics (pindyck and rubinfeld, 1998) . two-stage least-squares (2sls) and three-stage least squares (3sls) can both provide a very useful estimation procedure for simultaneous equation. however, 2sls is inefficient when the system of equations contains lagged dependent variables, which account for adjustments that take place over time. we can achieve a gain in efficiency by applying 3sls. it involves applying generalized least-squares estimation to a system of equations, each of which has first been estimated using 2sls. the 3sls procedure, also used for the parameter estimation in the simpler linear model in , yields more efficient parameter estimates than does 2sls because it takes into account the cross-equation correlation and hence is utilized here for parameter estimation. furthermore, we make use of the 3sls subroutine in sas package to estimate the model parameters. we add an error term in each equation when we employ 3sls to estimate the unknown parameters. moreover, to perform hypothesis tests for our model, we assume that the error terms follow a gaussian distribution in order to test whether each parameter is significantly different from zero. we would like to test for h 0 :b ¼ 0 (null hypotheses) versus h 1 :b6 ¼0 (alternative hypotheses). large value of t-statistic or small value of p-value leads to conclude that h 1 :b6 ¼0. the p-value is less than the specified level of significant a ¼ 0.05, we could conclude h a directly. the last column of tables 2 and 3 give the p-values for the estimations, indicating that the data are not consistent with b ¼ 0. note that the p-value is sometimes called the observed level of significance, with which one can conduct a test at any desired level of significance a by comparing the p-value with the specified level a.</td>\n",

       "      <td>acute viral respiratory tract infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in children, particularly those with compromised immune systems [1] [2] [3] . nucleic acid amplification tests have shown their superiority over classical diagnostic methods, such as direct fluorescent antibody detection (dfa) and viral isolation, in identifying a broader range of viruses, with higher sensitivity and specificity [4] [5] [6] . recently, several studies have demonstrated the advantages of multiplex pcr for simultaneous detection of a panel of viruses in one assay [7] [8]

seasonal and pandemic h1n1 2009 influenza a virus. multiplex assays. seven hundred and fifty nasopharyngeal (np) swabs were selected from children (birth to 17 years) with suspected respiratory tract infection seen at the hospital for sick children (toronto, canada). the first 25 specimens received each week for a 24-week period (november 2007 to april 2008), were selected, for a total of 600 specimens, without knowing results of dfa or viral isolation. an additional 150 specimens were chosen in the same manner (january 2009 to march 2009). nasopharyngeal swabs (flocked swabs; copan diagnostics, murrieta, ca, usa) were inoculated into 3 ml of universal transport medium (utm-rt copan diagnostics, murrieta, ca, usa). after vortexing, specimens from 2007/2008 (n = 600) were dispensed into four 400-ll aliquots and stored at )80°c until nucleic acid extraction, whereas specimens from 2009 (n = 150) were submitted to nucleic acid extraction before aliquoting and freezing at )80°c. specimen selection for comparison of assays to detect seasonal influenza a and pandemic h1n1 2009 influenza. a total of 130 np swab specimens were selected from aliquots of the original specimens frozen at )80°c on receipt: 75 influenza a positive specimens by astra screen and type assay (13 seasonal influenza a (infa)-h1, 12 infa-h3 and 50 pandemic h1n1 2009 influenza a (infa)-h1n1), and 55 influenza a/b negative specimens by the astra assay. all specimens were made anonymous and de-linked from all personal health identifiers. dfa was performed using fluorophore-labelled monoclonal antibodies against respiratory syncytial virus (rsv), parainfluenza viruses 1-3 (piv), adenovirus (adv), infa/b (simulfluor ò ; millipore, temecula, ca, usa) and human metapneumovirus (hmpv) (diagnostic hybrids, athens, oh, usa). dfa was carried out for each target as per the manufacturer's protocol. amplification products were detected using the liquichip 200 (luminex 200) (austin, tx, usa) for resplex ii v2.0, and the luminex 100 for rvp and rvp fast. qiagen instructs each user to determine appropriate cut-off values for their testing platform and patient population. cut-off values for resplex ii v2.0 were determined empirically to be the sum of the mean mfi plus ‡5 times the standard deviation of negative specimens (negative in all assays). the cut-off values for rvp and rvp fast were predetermined by the manufacturer. each assay had an internal control (ic) included to rule out pcr inhibition. table 1 shows the targets and characteristics of each multiplex assay. to detect amplification products, the seeplex rv15 assay was coupled with capillary electrophoresis technology (lab901screen tape system; lab901 ltd, loanhead, uk). true positive. for all targets except piv4, bov, coronaviruses, enterovirus and rhinovirus, any positive viral culture or a positive result for a single target from any two of dfa and the four molecular assays was considered true positive. because piv4, bov, coronaviruses, enterovirus and rhinovirus could not be detected by dfa or viral isolation, a true positive for these agents was defined as a positive result in at least two of the three or four multiplex pcr assays. distribution of respiratory viruses. virus isolation was performed on 684 specimens. of 750 specimens tested, 502 (66.9%) were considered true positive results for at least one virus by dfa, culture or pcr; 288/750 (38.4%) specimens were positive by dfa or viral isolation, while an additional 214 (28.5%) were positive by multiplex pcr. a single virus was detected in 420 specimens (83.7%), two viruses in 77 (15.3%), three in four specimens (0.8%) and four viruses in one (0.2%). table 2 shows the overall distribution of respiratory viral pathogens, indicating the predominance of enteroviruses/rhinoviruses, influenza viruses and rsv. it also shows that parainfluenza viruses, hmpv and coronaviruses accounted for about 7% each, followed by bocavirus and adenovirus at around 4% each. among dual infections (n = 77) entero/rhinoviruses were most commonly associated with other viruses. triple virusinfected specimens included adv + enterovirus/rhinovirus + bov (n = 1), piv4 + adv + enterovirus/rhinovirus (n = 1), rsvb + nl63 + bov (n = 1) and rsvb + piv4 + enterovirus/rhinovirus (n = 1). the unique quadruple-agent infected specimen was piv3 + nl63 + enterovirus/rhinovirus + bov (n = 1). comparison of sensitivity and specificity among assays. sensitivity and specificity were calculated for each target and assay according to our definition of a true and false positive (tables 3 and 4) . some viral targets were lumped together as necessary to perform a sensitivity and specificity analysis (i.e. entero/rhinovirus, coronaviruses). table 3 indicates that dfa and culture were, as expected, less sensitive than pcr for most targets. however, dfa was more sensitive than pcr for a small number of specific targets and assays (i. among all the multiplex assays tested, seeplex rv15 was the most sensitive for detecting all targets except for enteroviruses and rhinoviruses. all multiplex assays had good sensitivity for the detection of influenza a (93.7-98.4%). influenza b sensitivity was good in all multiplex assays (100%) except for rvp fast (64.9%). the superior performance of seeplex rv15 for rsv (100% sensitivity) reflected strong performance for both rsva and rsvb, whereas the decreased sensitivity of other assays reflected a weaker performance for either target (i.e. resplex ii v2.0: rsva 90.4%, rsvb 79.3%, and rvp: rsva 85.5%, rsvb 98.3%). similarly, variability in the sensitivity of individual targets of the four parainfluenza viruses resulted in variation in the overall sensitivity. again, seeplex rv15 showed good sensitivity for all four types (85.7-100%), while resplex ii v2.0 had reduced sensitivity for piv4 (60%), rvp had reduced sensitivity for piv1 (71.4%) and 3 (71.4%), and rvp fast had reduced sensitivity for piv1 (46.7%), 2 (77.8%) and 3 (42.8%). sensitivity for detecting hmpv was good for seeplex rv15, rvp and rvp fast (92.3-97.4%), and acceptable for resplex ii v2.0 (82%). however, performance for adenovirus, an important respiratory pathogen, was very variable, ranging from 52.4% (rvp fast) to 100% (seeplex rv15), probably reflecting the variation in serotype coverage among the assays. of the additional viral agents tested in the multiplex assays, the coronaviruses were consistently detected across all assays except for cov oc43 by rvp (53.8%) and cov hku1 by rvp fast (16.7%). seeplex rv15 and rvp fast detected 100% of bocavirus infections, while the sensitivity of resplex ii v2.0 was only 75%. detection of enterovirus and rhinovirus was the most inconsistent. although the specific targets for each multiplex assay are proprietary, it is known that the highly conserved regions of the 5¢ntr region of either rhinoviruses or enteroviruses, will also amplify members of the other genus. thus, some assays, such as the rvp and rvp fast assays, have combined the enterovirus and rhinovirus targets, because developing specific targets for each genus outside of the 5¢ntr region may compromise sensitivity of detection, especially of the rhinoviruses. this is possibly the case with the seeplex rv15 assay, which separates enteroviruses and rhinoviruses, but has a lower sensitivity than the other assays. though the resplex ii v2.0 assay differentiates between enteroviruses and rhinoviruses, the occurrence of 38.4% of positive specimens testing positive for both targets, suggests that there may be cross-reactivity between them. specificity was excellent for all assays, using our composite reference standard. without using individual single-plex assays to adjudicate the single test positives, we cannot determine whether the slightly lower specificity observed for a few targets in several assays was due to higher sensitivity of detection or detection of false positives. multiplexed respiratory panels provide clinicians with more diagnostic and treatment information for managing patients. in the case of influenza a, knowledge of the subtype is important with respect to predicting the activity of antiviral agents such as the adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors. in addition to increased sensitivity and number of viruses detected, multiplex assays permit the improved identification of cases of infection with multiple agents, which may be clinically significant, especially in immune compromised individuals. in our study, we found that two or more viruses were present in 10.9% of specimens (16.3% of positive specimens). bocavirus and coronaviruses were the viruses most commonly associated with multiple agent infection, followed by human metapneumovirus, the parainfluenza viruses, adenovirus and the entero/rhinoviruses. influenza a/b and rsv were the least likely to be detected in the presence of another virus. the role of multiple viral agents in affecting the clinical course of disease is at present unknown and worthy of further study. with respect to the technical performance of the different multiplex assays, the following issues were identified: seeplex rv15 was designed as a two-step rt-pcr format necessitating a separate rt (cdna) assay, though a new one-step procedure has been developed. it was the only assay that required three pcr master mixes with five targets in each one plus the internal control. it was also the only assay that incorporated positive controls for all 15 viral targets, which is considered an additional quality control feature of the assay. seeplex rv15 was the assay with the shortest post-pcr step, especially for a small number of specimens when using the lab 901 screen tape ò system (maximum five specimens per run). in contrast, the resplex ii v2.0, rvp and rvp fast use a 96-well microtitre plate format on the luminex platform, permitting high throughput analysis. practical considerations in most laboratories regarding the feasibility and the direct and indirect costs of introducing multiplex molecular testing for respiratory viruses have led to a relatively slow routine implementation of this methodology. mahony et al. [15] have shown that rvp employed as the first-line diagnostic tool in children was the least costly strategy, compared with dfa and culture, dfa alone or dfa plus rvp, when the prevalence of infection was ‡11%. the cost of molecular testing is offset by its more efficient use of labour than conventional dfa and culture and by savings to the healthcare system when additional testing and hospitalization can be avoided by knowledge of a test result with high sensitivity and specificity. operationally, molecular methods also allow virology laboratories to continue to function, even in the event that viral culture cannot be carried out due to biosafety issues. in our study, newer assays or versions of the multiplex assays (resplex ii plus panel pre (21 targets) and seeplex influenza a/b subtyping (six targets)) showed good sensitivity and specificity relative to a tri-plex influenza real-time rt-pcr (astra influenza screen &amp; type) for pandemic h1n1 2009 infa virus detection. this is important, as traditional seasonal h1 subtyping molecular assays will not react with the pandemic strain and it is expected that the 2009 pandemic strain may become the predominant circulating seasonal h1 strain in the immediate post-pandemic period. we have shown that multiplex pcr increases the sensitivity of detection of respiratory viruses in children by 74.3% over dfa and viral isolation, while maintaining excellent specificity. however, it will be important to develop more effective clinical and laboratory algorithms for their timely and optimal use and to study their impact on patient care in different populations in different clinical settings. influenza, rsv, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus and hmpv have been well established as leading causes of respiratory infection among infants and children [16] [17] [18] . however, the role of rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, bocavirus and coronaviruses as copathogens in upper respiratory tract infection or as agents of lower respiratory tract infection, has been less well investigated, and will be aided by studies using this technology [19] .</td>\n",

       "      <td>nipah virus, an enveloped ribonucleic acid virus, has been a major cause of encephalitis outbreaks with high mortality, primarily in the indo-bangladesh regions. except for the first outbreak in malaysia-singapore, which was related to contact with pigs and the outbreak in philippines associated with horse slaughter, most other outbreaks have affected the indo-bangladesh regions. the indo-bangladesh outbreaks were associated with consumption of raw date palm sap contaminated by fruit bats and had a very high secondary attack rate. the patient usually presents with fever, encephalitis and/or respiratory involvement with or without thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and transaminitis. diagnosis can be confirmed by isolation and nucleic acid amplification in the acute phase or antibody detection during the convalescent phase. treatment is mostly limited to supportive care and syndromic management of acute encephalitis syndrome. ribavirin, m102.4 monoclonal antibody and favipiravir are the only anti-virals with some activity against nipah virus. standard precautions, hand hygiene and personal protective equipments are the cornerstone of comprehensive infection prevention and control strategy. with the recent outbreaks affecting newer geographical areas, there is a need for physicians to be aware of this disease and keep abreast of its current detection and management strategies.</td>\n",
       "      <td>the name 'nipah' comes from a malaysian village, where the first outbreak was reported in 1998-1999 (1, 2) . the outbreak of nipah virus (niv) disease in malaysia involved more than 250 cases of febrile encephalitis in farm and abattoir workers. this outbreak caused widespread panic and considerable socioeconomic disruption. although, no further outbreaks were reported from malaysia the virus has been responsible for outbreaks in other parts of the world, mainly in bangladesh and india (2) . recent outbreak of nipah virus in kerala in may 2018 brought this emerging-re-emerging virus into the spotlight again. the high mortality rate, broad species tropism, multiple plausible modes of transmission, risk of person-person transmission and documented cases of health care workers being affected during outbreaks has left the medical community perplexed. while a lot remains to be deciphered about the virus and many efforts to unravel its mysteries are ongoing, this article has tried to review and synthesize the available information about this virus and its clinical aspects. the clinical information presented in this article can be used as a guiding tool for physicians in an outbreak setting. nipah virus is an enveloped paramyxovirus with negative-stranded polarity and a non-segmented rna genome consisting of helical nucleocapsids. niv has subtle differences in its makeup when compared to a typical paramyxovirus. it has reticular cytoplasmic inclusions close to the endoplasmic reticulum unlike other paramyxoviruses. also, niv is on average larger than typical paramyxoviruses. there are only minor ultrastructural differences between hendra virus (hev) and niv and they have significant cross reactivity on serological tests, and are therefore grouped as henipavirus (3) . within niv, two different strains have been identified, the malaysian (my) and the bangladesh (bd) strains. the two strains are approximately 92% identical on sequencing but appear to be significantly different in their pathogenicity and transmissibility (4-7). the first outbreak of nipah virus in malaysia-singapore (1998) (1999) was initially thought to be japanese encephalitis (je), however on further investigation, it was later identified as nipah virus ( figure 1 ) (3, 8, 9) . the second outbreak of this disease was in a geographically non-contiguous location, in the meherpur district of bangladesh and siliguri city of west bengal, india in 2001 (figures 1 and 2) . the indo-bangladesh outbreaks were significantly different from the previous outbreak in malaysia in terms of modes of transmission, clinical features and case fatality rates. human to human transmission and nosocomial infections (via droplets and/or fomites) were a prominent feature in this outbreak. also, the secondary attack rates were higher and the disease was more severe and rapidly progressive compared to the malaysian outbreak. apart from the neurological manifestations, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) and respiratory failure with multi organ dysfunction syndrome (mods) were probably the major reason for higher mortality. since then, there has been an outbreak in bangladesh almost every year and a total of 17 outbreaks have been reported until 2015. there was another small outbreak in 2007 in the nadia district of west bengal, india (figures 1 and 2 ). in the outbreak in the philippines in march-may, 2014, both horses and humans were affected with fruit bats being the possible source of infection. interestingly, this outbreak was significantly associated with horse slaughter and horse meat consumption (figures 1 and 2 ) (10) . the indian outbreak of 2018 affected primarily the kozhikode district and nearby area of kerala (figures 1  and 2 ) (11) . the malaysian outbreak was primarily due to close contact with affected pigs. no human to human transmission was reported (8, 12, 13) . the indo-bangladesh outbreaks, including the recent kerala outbreak, was remarkable in various aspects, mode of transmission being one of them. a significant association of niv disease and consumption of raw date palm sap contaminated by fruit bats was found by luby et al. (14) another study by rahman et al. also concluded with similar results (15) . in date palm sap the virus remains stable for at least 7 days at 22°c and is extremely tolerant to a wide range of ph (from 3 to 11) (16) . human to human and nosocomial transmission was also documented in the indo-bangladesh outbreaks. in the siliguri outbreak of 2001, a single patient admitted to a private hospital infected 23 hospital staff and 8 visitors (17) . poor adherence to standard precautions was probably the major reason for this. also, the difference in strains (bd vs. my) contributed to the difference in the transmission rates. a study by clayton et al. showed that ferrets infected with the bd strain had higher rna levels in the blood as well as increased shedding of the virus in oral secretions, possibly explaining the higher secondary attack rates as well as more severe infection in the indo-bangladesh outbreak. it is noteworthy that viral shedding was seen even in the incubation period (18) . the major research findings in different studies are tabulated in table 1 . clinical features of nipah typically includes fever with encephalitis and or respiratory involvement ( figure  3 ) (17, (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) . asymptomatic infection was reported in 8% of patients with laboratory-confirmed cases in malaysia. no such data of asymptomatic niv infection sensorium was the most common presentation. a case series of four outbreaks from bangladesh shows altered mental status (90%), headache (73%), severe weakness (67%) and seizures (23%) as common neurological manifestation (17) . nipah encephalitis may present with relapse or residual deficits in survivors. relapse of encephalitis has been demonstrated with a time range of months to years after recovery from acute infection. psychiatric and neurological complications (depression, personality changes, deficits in attention, verbal, and/ or visual memory) after recovery are also well known. goh et al. reports from their malaysian outbreak experience that 15 percent of their patients (14 patients) had residual deficits out of which five remained in a vegetative state (19) . respiratory involvement is well documented in severe cases. ards (50% to 66% cases) was documented in malaysian outbreak. siliguri outbreak witnessed 54 percent cases had associated respiratory symptoms particularly in the later stage of illness. is available from bangladesh and indian outbreaks. however, cases with mild and nonspecific features were identified. fever, headache, dizziness, myalgia, vomiting and loose stools have been documented as non-specific prodromal symptoms in various outbreaks of nipah. the malaysian outbreak documented that 55 percent of patients had a reduced level of consciousness and prominent brain-stem dysfunction (10) . distinctive clinical signs included segmental myoclonus (32%), areflexia, hypotonia, hypertension, and tachycardia and thus suggests the involvement of the brain stem and upper cervical spinal cord. brain stem dysfunction and neurological clinical signs include abnormal doll's eye reflex, reflexes, vasomotor changes, and myoclonic jerks. cerebellar dysfunction was seen in eight patients in the malaysian outbreak. in siliguri outbreak (2001) in india, fever followed by altered sensorium (97%) developing over the next 3 to 4 days was the presenting complaint. 34 percent of the cases had convulsions (20) . similarly, in bangladesh outbreaks, fever with altered s i g n i f i c a n t r e s p i r a t o r y involvement leading to ards in bangladesh strain of niv. --serology is cross reactive to hendra. ----respiratory involvement and higher mortality in bangladesh strain, compared to malaysia strain. major finding related to therapeutic options ribavirin can substantially reduce m o r t a l i t y ( 3 6 % ) w i t h o u t a n y significant adverse reactions. in vitro activity of ribavirin on halting the replication of niv in cell cultures. role of monoclonal antibody m102.4 in preventing transmission and halting disease progression among animal model of ferrets and african green monkey. promising role of favipiravir in protecting niv infected animals (hamster model). common hematologic abnormalities in niv infection include thrombocytopenia (30%) and leukopenia (11%) ( table 2) . elevated liver enzymes have been seen in 40% of patients, and hyponatraemia is sometimes found. hemoglobin, renal indices and electrolytes other than sodium are usually normal. lymphocytic pleocytosis with raised proteins similar to any other viral meningitis may be seen in cerebrospinal fluid. niv is a biosafety level (bsl) 4 agent, however, bsl 2 laboratory facilities are sufficient for routine diagnosis if the virus is inactivated during specimen collection and isolation is not attempted. laboratory diagnosis of a patient with a clinical history of niv can be made during the acute and convalescent phases of the disease by using a combination of tests. samples should be transported at 4°c and processed as early as possible. during the early stage of illness -virus isolation and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay (rt pcr) from throat and nasal swabs, cerebrospinal fluid (csf), urine, and blood is recommended (24) . during the convalescent phase, antibody detection by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa-igg and igm) from serum or csf may be used. advanced diffusion weighted (dw) magnetic resonance imaging (mri) of the brain can give useful radiological evidence of nipah encephalitis. lim et al. suggested that mri pattern may be useful in differentiating nipah from its closely differential related japanese encephalitis/other encephalitis in most cases (25) . it can also help to diagnose exposed individuals, particularly at the height of an epidemic even before serologic confirmation is available (19) . this finding derived from malaysian experience during nipah outbreak needs validation from other occurrences. more experience is required for its validation but this can be a potentially crucial finding to diagnose nipah encephalitis and decide treatment and post exposure prophylaxis. mri in acute nipah encephalitis shows multifocal discrete lesions probably due to areas of micro-infarction. these discrete high-signal-intensity lesions usually measure about 2-7 mm and are disseminated throughout the brain, mainly in the subcortical and deep white matter of the cerebral hemispheres. mass effect or edema is not usually seen. in relapse or late onset nipah encephalitis, mri characteristically shows multiple areas of patchy and confluent cortical involvement (26,27). nipah is an important differential diagnosis in patients with fever and encephalitis and/or ards in context of relevant epidemiology with an ongoing outbreak in the area or relevant travel history to affected areas. but any fever or encephalitis may mimic disease and differentials need to be seen in correct perspective. the following differentials should be considered in patients with suspected nipah infection: a) japanese encephalitis (je), b) measles, c) rabies, d) dengue encephalitis, e) cerebral malaria, f) scrub typhus, g) leptospirosis, h) herpes encephalitis and i) bacterial meningitis (table 3) . treatment of niv disease is mostly limited to supportive (28) . under the current circumstances, specific pharmacological options should not be treated as alternatives to infection control measures. more evidence needs to be generated for considering postexposure prophylaxis in individuals who were in close contact with confirmed nipah cases. however, three pharmacological options have been explored for the possible treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis of niv infection: ribavirin, m102.4 monoclonal antibody and favipiravir. in vitro studies and animal studies have shown conflicting results in the efficacy of ribavirin against niv and hendra, with some studies showing effective inhibition of viral replication in cell lines (29, 30) , whereas some studies in animal models showed that ribavirin treatment only delayed but did not prevent death after nipah or hendra virus infection (31, 32) . only one in-vivo human study by chong et al. has evaluated the role of ribavirin during the malaysia outbreak of niv, between 1998 and 1999 (33) . in this study, patients who were managed prior to the availability of ribavirin during the outbreak or who refused ribavirin were taken as controls, and all patients who were still in the acute phase of the illness were offered ribavirin, either oral or intravenous, based on availability. a total of 140 patients treated with ribavirin were retrospectively compared with 52 control niv patients who did not receive ribavirin due to unavailability and 2 patients who didn't consent there was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse reactions in the treatment group as compared to controls. the study showed 45 deaths in the treated group (32%) and 29 in the controls (54%), with a total of 36% reduction in mortality. however, as treatment allocation was not randomized, it is possible that treated patients had better clinical outcomes because they received better general medical care than the untreated patients. the dosage of ribavirin in nipah virus has not been defined but treatment can be initiated in the lines of that suggested by who for lassa fever with a loading dose of 30 mg/kg for children and 2,000 mg/kg for adults, followed by 10 days of therapy (4 g in divided doses for first four days and 2 g in divided doses for next six days). oral bioavailability of ribavirin is reported to be between 32.6% and 52%, with evidence of first-pass metabolism. ribavirin is not bound to plasma proteins (34) . ribavirin was found to cross the blood-brain barrier following oral administration with a mean csf/plasma ratio of 0.7 (35) . the serious adverse drug reactions with ribavirin are: neutropenia (8% to 40%), anemia (11% to 35%; children &amp; adolescents: 11%), lymphocytopenia (12% to 14%) and suicidal ideations (36) . most of the side-effects with ribavirin have been noticed with long term administration. ribavirin has been found to be teratogenic in animal studies on rodents and rabbits, but no human teratogenic studies are available. due to the long terminal half-life of elimination of the drug, the minimum interval following treatment with ribavirin before pregnancy can be safely initiated is estimated to be 7 months (36) . the infectious diseases society of america has recommended in 2008 the use of ribavirin in cases of niv infections (37) . owing to the positive in-vivo and in-vitro results and a considerable safety profile for short term courses, a strong case can be made favoring short course high dose ribavirin for therapy. however, a controlled trial is lacking to resolve the status, for which a pre-approval should be taken from the appropriate authority, so that the trial may be immediately started with the onset of a future outbreak. the experimental monoclonal antibody, m102.4, which targets the ephrin-b2 and ephrin-b3 receptor binding domain of the henipavirus g envelope glycoprotein is a potent cross-reactive neutralizing antibody in vitro. it was effective in protecting ferrets from lethal niv challenge (38) . in may 2010, in queensland, australia, m102.4 was offered as a trial on compassionate grounds to a mother and daughter who were exposed to hendra virus from their infected horse. both of them did not develop hendra virus infection, although it is still not known whether treatment was effective or whether the patients did not get infected. in an animal study comprised of 14 african green monkey (agm) subjects, m102.4 prevented infection and death after injection of a lethal dose of niv in 12 agm subjects. both the control agm subjects contracted severe infection and developed encephalitis as well as ards (39). the viral rna-dependent rna polymerase inhibitor favipiravir was developed by toyama chemical company as an antiviral for use against influenza. in a syrian hamster model for nipah virus infection, favipiravir was successfully used in lethally challenged hamsters (40). case fatality rates ranges from 40% to 100%. poor prognostic factors from the malaysian outbreak included old age, more severe brain-stem involvement presenting as a reduced level of consciousness, vomiting, abnormal doll's-eye reflex, abnormal pupils, hypertension, and tachycardia during the course of the illness (19) . the morbidity and mortality of healthcare workers involved in care of patients with niv is a major concern (13, 17, (41) (42) (43) (44) . although, there is still a lot of confusion about transmission and spread of this paramyxovirus, there is a need to lay guidelines for protection of the healthcare workforce based on present evidence and resources available. a leaf can be drawn from the successful containment of ebola and severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) outbreaks, which affected health care workers (hcws) (45). standard precautions, hand hygiene and personal protective equipment (ppe) remain as pillars of comprehensive infection prevention and control strategy (46, 47) . all hospitals should adhere to standard infection control precautions for all patient-care activities and aerosol-generating procedures. in case of niv infection in health-care settings, additional measures, such as droplet, contact and airborne precautions should be applied. droplet precautions rely on isolation (one-patient isolation rooms or cohorting [i.e., grouping patients infected with the same infectious agents together to confine their care to one area and prevent contact with susceptible patients]) and keeping the patient with an existing roommate. a patient that meets the criteria for a suspect nipah case should immediately be isolated and infection control precautions instituted. in general, hospitals in at-risk areas need to be prepared for the management of nipah cases via hospital screening, admission procedures and triage, and the management of visitor access and movement should be in place to minimize potential exposure. standard precautions should be applied while handling patients, handling the deceased, handling the specimens, cleaning and waste disposal. hand hygiene: handwashing with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub before and after patient contact. evidence from bangladesh suggested that nipah virus can survive on surfaces and be a potential source of spread of infection to caregivers (44) . lack of hand hygiene practices and scarcity of water in the setting was possibly responsible for hcws being affected in the outbreak (44) . the importance of hand hygiene cannot be over emphasized and it remains the crucial cornerstone for preventing spread of infection (44, 46, 48) . wearing of ppe when performing an aerosol generating procedure or a patient examination. highest level of protection (level b/a osha) is recommended for nipah. infections in hcws with sars or ebola during the respective outbreaks were very commonly attributed to improper ppe removal or doffing (49-52). nipah virus outbreak should be suspected in relevant epidemiological settings (e.g. history of travel or residence in known geographical areas with nipah transmission or contact with pigs or bats) in clusters of patients presenting with acute encephalitis with or without ards, high secondary attack rate and very high mortality. these patients should be managed with appropriate infection control measures. until the time when newer drugs are developed for its effective treatment, the role of drugs like ribavirin has to be clearly established with the help of properly designed trials. effective control measures in the community to prevent its transmission from animals (bats/pigs) to humans in disease prone areas have to be instituted. in the battle of virus vs. man, hopefully the latter will turn out to be victorious in the long run.</td>\n",

       "      <td>person to person droplets/particles or contaminant cross transmission is an important issue in ventilated environment, especially in the unidirectional ventilated protective isolation room (uvpir) where the patient's immune system is extremely low and easily infected. we simulated the dispersion process of the droplets with initial diameter of 100 μm, 10 μm and gaseous contaminant in unidirectional ventilated protective isolation room and studied the droplets dispersion and cross transmission with different sizes. the droplets with initial size of 100 μm settle out of the coughing jet quickly after coming out from mouth and cannot be carried by the coughing jet to the human thermal plume affecting (htpa) zone of the susceptible manikin. hence, the larger droplets disperse mainly in the htpa zone of the source manikin, and the droplets cross transmission between source manikin and susceptible manikin is very small. the droplets with initial size of 10 μm and gaseous contaminant have similar dispersion but different removal process in the uvpir. part of the droplets with initial size of 10 μm and gaseous contaminant that are carried by the higher velocity coughing airflow can enter the htpa zone of the susceptible manikin and disperse around it. the other part cannot spread to the susceptible manikin's htpa zone and mainly spread in the source manikin's htpa zone. the results from this study would be useful for uvpir usage and operation in order to minimize the risk of cross infection.</td>\n",
       "      <td>transmission of infectious diseases in indoor environment has been receiving more and more attentions. existing research shows that some infectious diseases such as sars, tuberculosis, influenza, etc. can all spread through air (yu et al. 2004; li et al. 2007) . humans produce droplets during expiratory activities such as coughing, talking, and sneezing. if these droplets are produced by an infected person, pathogenic contaminants can be transmitted to other people and lead to cross-infection. single room isolation with unidirectional, high efficiency particulate air filter (hepa) filtering airflow from the entire ceiling unit has been used to protect patients who need the most protection (yang et al. 2015) . in such clean wards, \"laminar\" (not in real sense) airflow moves in parallel and same direction with almost same velocity from the air supply opening to the air return opening (gregory et al. 2007) . such a unidirectional airflow ventilation system is believed to be able to control the particle/droplet or other contaminant cross transmission and can be removed effectively. some existing study indicated that unidirectional ventilation system combined with an appropriate air filtration system could greatly decrease the cross infection risk and increase patient survival rate effectively (storb et al. 1983 ; barnes and rogers 1989; passweg et al. 1998; schlesinger et al. 2009 ). as discussed in previous study, although the unidirectional ventilated protective isolation room (uvpir) is patient room in hospital, it has difference with airborne infection isolation room (aiir) and operating theatre (ot) (yang et al. 2015) . hence, the research findings in aiir and ot may not applicable in uvpir. laminar airflow system has been widely used in operating theatre to decrease rates of surgical site infections (ssi). in recent years, some scholars doubted the effect of laminar airflow on the reduction of wound infections. for example, gastmeir et al. (2012) investigated the influence of laminar airflow on the surgical site infections and concluded that it would be a waste of resources to establish new operating room with laminar airflow system. james et al. (2015) reviewed the current literature for the use of laminar airflow operating theatre ventilation during total joint arthroplasty and examined the effectiveness of laminar airflow on preventing post-operative wound infection and found that there is no conclusive effect on the reduction of post-operative wound infections by laminar airflow system. the vertical laminar airflow system directs air from ceiling to floor. the airflow passes over the head and upper body of the surgeon and assistants to the surgical site. during surgical procedures, bacteria-laden dust particles, textile fibers, and respiratory aerosols may be released from the surgical team in to the air of the operating room. these bacteria may be carried by the downward airflow to settle on the surgical instruments or directly enter the surgical site and lead to surgical site infection (james et al. 2015; mchugh et al. 2015) . the key reason that the vertical laminar airflow may lead to surgical site infection is that the bacteria sources (the head and upper body of the surgeon and assistant) located at the upper area of the patient. the relative positions of patient and doctors or nurses are different in uvpir and operating theatre. the vertical laminar airflow from the whole ceiling in the uvpir will create an entire protective environment for the patient from being infected from doctors or nurses who may enter into the ward. the bacteria from the doctors or nurses will be carried by the downward airflow to the floor level and removed from the exhaust opening located at the bottom of the two sidewalls. hence, using vertical laminar airflow system to decrease cross infection risk is more appropriate in uvpir than in operating theatre. a lot of related work on person to person droplets/ particles or contaminant cross transmission in different ventilation systems can be found in the literature. for example, chen et al. (2010) investigated the droplets/particles cross transmission between dental healthcare workers and patient. cao et al. (2015) examined the performance of protected zone ventilation and hybrid protected zone ventilation in reducing person to person airborne cross transmission in office room by experiment. habchi et al. (2014) studied the cross-infection between occupants in the room with a mathematical multi-plume multi-layer transport model. habchi et al. (2016) investigated the direct and indirect cross-contamination in office space with ceiling personalized ventilation combined with desk fans. he et al. (2011) investigated the exhaled droplet cross-transmission between occupants in a typical office room with different ventilation strategies. li et al. (2011) adopted a novel modeling approach to directly assess the inhalation dose of infectious droplets and estimated the exposure risk for the co-occupant under different ventilation methods. olmedo et al. (2013) investigated the risk of airborne cross-infection between the two breathing thermal manikins in a room with vertical low-velocity ventilation. nielsen et al. (2012) studied the cross transmission of the exhaled small particles between two people standing in surrounding with a vertical temperature gradient. most of these studies indicated the importance of using appropriate particle sizes in conducting this type of study. the issue is particularly important for uvpir where the patient may be exposed to various types of bio-aerosols generated from others. back in the 1940s, duguid (1946) studied the sizes of droplets from speaking, coughing and sneezing through microscopic measurement, and found that the range of the droplets diameters was from 1 μm to 2000 μm and 95% of the droplets were less than 100 μm. chao et al. (2009) measured the droplet size using the interferometric mie imaging (imi) technique. the droplet size distribution obtained by their study was more in line with the data obtained by duguid (1946) . the geometric mean diameter of the droplets expelled from coughing and speaking was 13.5 μm and 16.0 μm, respectively from their study. the droplet concentrations were range from 0.004 to 0.223 cm −3 for speaking and 2.4-5.2 cm −3 per cough for coughing. the average number of droplets/particles emitted each sneeze and cough was 1 × 10 6 and 5 × 10 3 , respectively. larger droplets may settle out of the airflow quickly and thus the cross transmission only happens when the individuals are close enough. smaller droplets may hang in the air for longer time and spread for longer distance, thus will have higher risk of cross transmission between person to person (riley 1974; brachman 1990 ). overall, existing research showed that the droplets of different sizes have different dispersion characteristics and cross transmission risk. previously, we have developed a computational model to simulate the airflow and contaminant dispersion in uvpir (yang et al. 2015) . however, air contaminant generated from human source was overly simplified as gaseous in that study. the goal of this study is to further understand the droplets dispersion characteristics and cross transmission risk with different sizes in unidirectional ventilated protective isolation room. in our previous study, cfd software (fluent 2005) was used to simulate the airflow and gaseous contaminant concentration in uvpir. rng k-ε turbulence model was selected to simulate the airflow field in uvpir. the simulation model was validated against experimental data (yang et al. 2015) . built upon this airflow model, we intend to simulate the dispersion process of the droplets with the following three initial sizes: large (100 μm), medium (10 μm), and small (represented by gaseous contaminant). particles smaller than 2 μm were found to share the common dispersion and transport properties of air (chen et al. 2006) . it is feasible to simulate the smaller particle with species transport model, but not for larger particles concerned in this study. each droplet released from manikin's mouth was tracked individually in a lagrangian frame for its instantaneous position, velocity and other parameters. generally for the particles observed in indoor air, other forces such as the basset history, the pressure gradient and the virtual mass are negligible compared with the drag force (zhao et al. 2004 ). the density and size of the droplets investigated in this study are all similar with their study, hence, the basset force, the pressure gradient force and the virtual mass force are ignored in our simulation. the stokes drag force, the saffman's lift force, thermophoretic force and gravitational force were considered in this study. thus, the lagrangian equations describing the motion of the droplets are p p d d the droplet characteristic time in eq. (2) is defined as the cunningham slip correction factor c c for small size droplets in eq. (4) is ρ p is the density of the droplet, d p is the diameter of the droplet, λ is the mean free path. the gradient of diffusion due to the vapor pressure equilibrium at the droplet's surface is used to calculate the vaporization rate of the droplets: where nu aw is the nusselt correlation at the air-water interface. d m is the mass diffusion coefficient. c in eqs. (6) and (7) is the mass transfer coefficient; the value of c is calculated from a nusselt correlation (ranz and marshall 1952) . sc is the schmidt number. r is the universal gas constant. p sat (t p ) is the saturated water vapor pressure. t p is the temperature of the droplets. x i is the local bulk mole fraction of water vapor, p op is the operating pressure, and t ¥ is the local bulk temperature in the air. heat balance equation is used to simulate the droplet temperature. it is the sensible heat change in the droplet to the latent heat of evaporation and the convective heat transfer between the droplet and the air: where m p is the mass of droplet, c p is the specific heat capacity of droplet, h fg is the latent heat of evaporation. h is the heat transfer coefficient, and is obtained in similar way: where κ eff is the effective thermal conductivity, pr is prandtl number. the airflow turbulence model and gaseous contaminant simulation model have been validated previously (yang et al. 2015) . we only need to validate the droplet simulation model here. chao and wan (2006) tested the dispersion of expiratory aerosols in unidirectional downward ventilation room with dimensions of 4.8 m × 4.8 m × 2.6 m (width × length × height). the tested ventilation type is quite similar to unidirectional ventilated protective isolation room investigated in this study. the droplet emission source was located at the center of the testing room, 0.8 m above the floor. droplets were emitted vertically upward. we simulated their experimental cases with the simulation model discussed above and compared with the data. figure 1 indicates that the predicted vertical position trajectory of droplets matches well with the experiment results. we simulated the droplets cross transmission between two manikins in uvpir in this study. the size of the room is 3 m × 2.5 m × 3 m (width-x, height-y, and length-z). clean air is supplied into the room through ceiling-mounted hepa filters with the opening size of 3 m × 3 m (width-x and length-z). the air is exhausted from the outlets located on the bottom of two sidewalls of the room, with each opening size being 0.3 m × 3 m (height-y, and width-x). two standing manikins with 1.0 m apart are located in the room, as shown in fig. 2 . the blue manikin represents the susceptible and the red manikin represents the source. the heights of both manikins are 1.7 m. wells (1934) defined large droplets as those over 100 μm in aerodynamic diameter. hence, 100 μm is selected in this study to investigate the transmission characteristics of large fig. 2 the schematic of the simulated room and manikins droplets. lindsley et al. (2010) measured the influenza virus in aerosol particles from human coughs and found that not only that coughing by patients emitted aerosols containing the influenza virus, but also that much of the influenza viral was contained within particles in the respirable size range. 35% of the detected influenza rna was contained in particles &gt;4 μm, 23% in particles of 1-4 μm, and 42% in particles &lt;1 μm. 10 μm is selected in this study to examine the transmission characteristics of medium droplets. gaseous contaminant is also studied to represent small droplets (smaller than 1 μm) and chemical contaminant. velocity inlet boundary condition was used for the inlet opening, the supply air velocity was 0.25 m/s which was recommended by yang et al. (2015) and the supply air temperature was set to 24 °c. the mass flow rate at outlet was equal to that of inlet. the heat fluxes of room enclosure surfaces were all set to 0. the body surface temperature of the manikins was set to 33 °c (yang et al. 2015) . based on the research of mcfadden et al. (1985) , the temperature of coughing air from source manikin's mouth and the breathing air from both source and susceptible manikins' noses were set to 32 °c. the flow boundary conditions at the mouth and nose of the source manikin were different depending on whether he/she was breathing or coughing. in our simulation, the coughing airflow came from source manikin's mouth; the airflow from source manikin's nose was 0 during coughing. after coughing, the source manikin breathed with nose and the airflow rate from mouth was 0. the susceptible manikin breathed with nose during all simulating time and the airflow rate from his/her mouth was 0. the boundary conditions of the exhalation at source manikin and susceptible manikin's fig. 1 the comparison of the predicted vertical position of the droplets with the experimental data by chao and wan (2006) mouth and nose were specified according to the study of gupta et al. (2009 gupta et al. ( , 2010 . droplets were composed of organic ions, aqueous solution containing inorganic and glycoproteins. the relative humidity has great influence on the dispersion of the droplets in the room. low relative humidity results in rapid evaporation and thus leads to the increase of the suspended particles in the room air (arundel et al. 1986 ). the relative humidity (rh) in the supply air was set to 50%, as recommended by the chinese standard gb 50457-2008 (2009) . the relative humidity of the breathing and coughing air was set to 100%. when expelled from source manikin's mouth, the droplets entered into an environment that had a lower temperature and relative humidity than that in the coughing air. the detailed settings of boundary conditions are shown in table 1 . the airflow field in the simulated uvpir is shown in fig. 3 . the stream lines are almost parallel above the manikins' heads. the downward airflow directions are changed by the thermal plume from manikin and created two \"human thermal plume affecting zones\" (htpa zones), which is defined as the vortex area affected by the human thermal plume (yang et al. 2014) . the downward airflow near the manikin is pulled up by the manikin thermal plume and creates a vortex airflow around the human body. the existence of the htpa zone has mixed effects. on one hand, the htpa zone around the manikin can create a protective barrier and prevent the contaminant from entering the zone fig. 3 the airflow field in the uvpir and avoid contaminant cross transmission. on the other hand, if the contaminants are entrained into the htpa zone, the upward airflow in the zone will carry the contaminant to the manikin's breathing zone and lead to cross transmission. the effective way to decrease cross transmission is to prevent contaminants from entering the htpa zone of the susceptible manikin. the dispersion process of the droplets with initial diameter of 100 μm from coughing is shown in fig. 4 . these droplets carried by the coughing jet can move forward for a very short distance (less than 0.3 m) before going downward, and mainly disperse in the htpa zone of the source manikin after that. the droplets settle out of the coughing jet quickly after emitted from source manikin's mouth. very few droplets remain in the uvpir one minute after. figure 5 shows the dispersion process of the droplets with initial diameter of 10 μm. approximate 60% of the droplets carried by the coughing jet move forward for approximately 0.6 m, enter into and disperse in the htpa zone of the susceptible manikin. the other parts of droplets (approximate 40%) remain in the htpa zone of the source manikin and mainly disperse around the source manikin area. as shown in table 1 , the peak coughing velocity can reach 9 m/s. such high velocity coughing jet can easily break out the protective barrier and enter into the htpa zone of susceptible manikin. however, after coughing, the source manikin respires via nose. the peak breathing velocity drops down to 2.9 m/s. during the respiration process, the breathing air cannot break out the protective barrier and enter the htpa zone of the susceptible as shown in fig. 5 . hence, when the velocity of the coughing airflow is higher (much higher than 2.9 m/s), the droplets can be carried by the high fig. 4 the dispersion process of droplets with initial diameter of 100 μm velocity coughing jet to the susceptible manikin's htpa zone. but when the velocity of the coughing airflow is lower, the droplets cannot reach the susceptible manikin's htpa zone. one minute after, most of the droplets are removed from the room. the dispersion process of the gaseous droplets is shown in fig. 6 . similar to the dispersion process of the droplets with initial diameter of 10 μm, part of the gaseous contaminants are carried by the higher velocity coughing jet to a longer distance in 3 seconds and enter the htpa zone of the susceptible manikin directly. other gaseous contaminants carried by the lower velocity coughing airflow remain in the htpa zone of the source manikin. five seconds after, the two parts of gaseous contaminants are dispersed in the htpa zones of susceptible and source manikins respectively. the gaseous contaminant concentrations in the area close to the body of two manikins are higher than that of other places. the contaminant is diluted gradually with time. fig. 5 the dispersion process of droplets with initial diameter of 10 μm fig. 6 the dispersion process of gaseous droplets one minute after, the contaminant concentration near the manikin is already diluted by 10 000 times. the dispersion processes of the droplets with initial diameter of 10 μm and gaseous contaminant are similar from the comparison between figs. 5 and 6. figure 7 shows how the droplet sizes change with time for different initial size droplets. for the droplets with initial size of 10 μm, the size remains nearly the same in the first 2 seconds due to high relative humidity of the breathing air, and then decreases rapidly to 2.6 μm in the following 0.4 seconds. the droplets with initial size of 10 μm become droplet nuclei with size of 2.6 μm rapidly after entering into the room. zhao and wu (2005) proposed an indicator to judge whether the particle can be treated as passive transport or gaseous contaminant. by calculating, we found when the particle size is less than 10 μm, the indicators of the droplets/particles in uvpir under 0.25 m/s air supply velocity are all lower than the upper limit (2.8e−02 s 2 ) suggested by zhao and wu (2005) . based on this, if the size of the droplet nuclei is less than 10 μm (which corresponds to 30 μm initial size of the droplet from fig. 7) , the droplet dispersion would be similar to that of gaseous contaminant. the droplets with initial size of 100 μm need 6 seconds to become the droplets nuclei with the size of 26 μm. for larger particles, the dispersion characteristics are of great difference than gaseous contaminant. figure 8 shows the total quantity of droplets changing with time in the uvpir. for the droplets with initial size of 100 μm and 10 μm, only 1% left in the room air after one minute. but for the gaseous contaminant, 15% of the contaminant left in the room air after one minute. although the droplets with initial size of 10 μm and the gaseous contaminant have similar dispersion process in the uvpir, their total quantities in the room air decay process are different. the reason is that the droplets deposit on the surfaces in the room during the transmission, not the gaseous contaminant. the quantity of the droplets with initial size of 100 μm has a rapid decrease in the first 5 seconds. the reason is that the droplets mainly disperse around the source manikin body surface in the first 10 seconds (as shown in fig. 4) , which leads to a great chance of settling and over 10% of the droplets deposit onto the body surface. the quantity of the droplets with initial size of 10 μm also has obvious decay at the first 15 seconds, but both the amount and the rate of decay are much smaller than that of the droplets with initial size of 100 μm. for the decay process of the gaseous contaminant, the quantity of the gaseous contaminant remains unchanged at the first 10 seconds and decreases gradually after that. the total amount of the gaseous contaminant drops to 20% in 30 seconds, and the decay rate becomes quite small after that. one minute after, 15% of the gaseous contaminant remains in the room. the schematic diagram of the dispersion process of the droplets in the uvpir is summarized in fig. 9 . from the discussions above, large droplets have larger settling velocity, so that the droplets settle out of the coughing jet quickly after coming out from mouth and cannot be carried by the coughing jet to the htpa zone of the susceptible manikin. hence, the larger droplets disperse mainly in the htpa zone of the source manikin, and the droplets cross transmission between source manikin and susceptible manikin should be very small. but for small droplets/gaseous contaminants, part of them are carried by the higher velocity coughing fig. 7 the size change with time of the droplets with different initial sizes fig. 8 the total quantity of droplets change with time in the uvpir fig. 9 the schematic diagram of the dispersion process of the droplets in the uvpir jet to the htpa zone of the susceptible manikin and lead to cross transmission. the remaining contaminants carried by the lower velocity coughing jet remain in the htpa zone of the source manikin. this indicates that a potential effective measure to reduce person to person cross transmission in uvpir is to decrease the velocity of coughing jet like wearing a mask. we simulated the dispersion process of the droplets with initial diameter of 100 μm and 10 μm and gaseous contaminant in a uvpir and studied the droplets dispersion characteristics and cross transmission with different sizes. we can get the following conclusions: (1) for the droplets with initial size of 100 μm, the droplets settle out of the coughing jet quickly and cannot be carried by the coughing jet to the htpa zone of the susceptible manikin. almost all the droplets are left in the source manikin's htpa zone and dispersion in it. (2) the droplets with initial size of 10 μm and gaseous contaminant have similar dispersion process but different decay process in the uvpir. (3) part of the small droplets and gaseous contaminant that are carried by the higher velocity coughing airflow can enter the htpa zone of the susceptible manikin and disperse around it. the other part cannot spread to the susceptible manikin's htpa zone and mainly spread in the source manikin's htpa zone.</td>\n",

       "1  during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) outbreak, traditional intervention measures such as quarantine and border control were found to be useful in containing the outbreak. we used laboratory verified sars case data and the detailed quarantine data in taiwan, where over 150,000 people were quarantined during the 2003 outbreak, to formulate a mathematical model which incorporates level a quarantine (of potentially exposed contacts of suspected sars patients) and level b quarantine (of travelers arriving at borders from sars affected areas) implemented in taiwan during the outbreak. we obtain the average case fatality ratio and the daily quarantine rate for the taiwan outbreak. model simulations is utilized to show that level a quarantine prevented approximately 461 additional sars cases and 62 additional deaths, while the effect of level b quarantine was comparatively minor, yielding only around 5% reduction of cases and deaths. the combined impact of the two levels of quarantine had reduced the case number and deaths by almost a half. the results demonstrate how modeling can be useful in qualitative evaluation of the impact of traditional intervention measures for newly emerging infectious diseases outbreak when there is inadequate information on the characteristics and clinical features of the new disease-measures which could become particularly important with the looming threat of global flu pandemic possibly caused by a novel mutating flu strain, including that of avian variety. r   \n",
       "2  this study compares the performance of four commercial multiplex pcr assays (resplex ii panel v2.0, seeplex rv15, xtag rvp and xtag rvp fast) and direct fluorescent antibody (dfa) staining and viral isolation. seven hundred and fifty nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for 17 viral agents. in each assay, the sensitivity and specificity for each target were determined against a composite reference standard. two hundred and eighty-eight out of 750 (38.4%) specimens were positive by dfa or viral isolation, while an additional 214 (28.5%) were positive by multiplex pcr, for a total positivity rate of 66.9%. of 502 positive specimens, one virus was detected in 420 specimens (83.7%), two in 77 (15.3%), three in four (0.8%) and four in one case (0.2%). compared with a composite reference standard, the inter-assay accuracy of the multiplex pcr assays varied, but all were superior to conventional diagnostic methods in detecting a broad range of respiratory viral agents in children. in addition, the sensitivity of two commercial assays, resplex ii plus pre and seeplex influenza a/b subtyping, was determined relative to the astra influenza screen & type assay for detection of influenza a viruses, including seasonal influenzas and pandemic h1n1 2009 influenza a virus. using 75 positive and 55 negative nasopharyngeal swabs for influenza a by the astra assay, the sensitivity of seeplex and resplex was 95.9% and 91.8%, respectively, with a specificity of 100% for both.                                                      \n",
       "3  nipah virus, an enveloped ribonucleic acid virus, has been a major cause of encephalitis outbreaks with high mortality, primarily in the indo-bangladesh regions. except for the first outbreak in malaysia-singapore, which was related to contact with pigs and the outbreak in philippines associated with horse slaughter, most other outbreaks have affected the indo-bangladesh regions. the indo-bangladesh outbreaks were associated with consumption of raw date palm sap contaminated by fruit bats and had a very high secondary attack rate. the patient usually presents with fever, encephalitis and/or respiratory involvement with or without thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and transaminitis. diagnosis can be confirmed by isolation and nucleic acid amplification in the acute phase or antibody detection during the convalescent phase. treatment is mostly limited to supportive care and syndromic management of acute encephalitis syndrome. ribavirin, m102.4 monoclonal antibody and favipiravir are the only anti-virals with some activity against nipah virus. standard precautions, hand hygiene and personal protective equipments are the cornerstone of comprehensive infection prevention and control strategy. with the recent outbreaks affecting newer geographical areas, there is a need for physicians to be aware of this disease and keep abreast of its current detection and management strategies.                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "4  person to person droplets/particles or contaminant cross transmission is an important issue in ventilated environment, especially in the unidirectional ventilated protective isolation room (uvpir) where the patient's immune system is extremely low and easily infected. we simulated the dispersion process of the droplets with initial diameter of 100 μm, 10 μm and gaseous contaminant in unidirectional ventilated protective isolation room and studied the droplets dispersion and cross transmission with different sizes. the droplets with initial size of 100 μm settle out of the coughing jet quickly after coming out from mouth and cannot be carried by the coughing jet to the human thermal plume affecting (htpa) zone of the susceptible manikin. hence, the larger droplets disperse mainly in the htpa zone of the source manikin, and the droplets cross transmission between source manikin and susceptible manikin is very small. the droplets with initial size of 10 μm and gaseous contaminant have similar dispersion but different removal process in the uvpir. part of the droplets with initial size of 10 μm and gaseous contaminant that are carried by the higher velocity coughing airflow can enter the htpa zone of the susceptible manikin and disperse around it. the other part cannot spread to the susceptible manikin's htpa zone and mainly spread in the source manikin's htpa zone. the results from this study would be useful for uvpir usage and operation in order to minimize the risk of cross infection.                     \n",

       "0  willingness of the general public to comply with protective public health measures in the event of pandemic infl uenza is necessary for success in disease response and containment. in addition, better estimates of population compliance with such measures is valuable when assessing their contributions in the mathematical modeling of pandemics and in estimating the effectiveness of pandemic control decisions and policies; both in terms of disease containment and cost. a recent systematic review of physical interventions to reduce the spread of respiratory diseases 1 has clearly demonstrated the signifi cant contribution of simple low-cost interventions, such as mask-wearing and hand washing. data in this review, from severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars)-related studies, indicated that mask-wearing reduced risk of spread by 68%; a fi gure that increased to 91% if n95 masks were worn. review of the australian management plan for pandemic infl uenza 2 and the nsw state health action plan 3 suggests that the need for the general population to wear face masks is likely to be a key component in ensuring continuity of essential services (eg, public needing to wear face masks in health care settings), and in supporting societal functioning (eg, people wearing face masks on public transport or when in common public areas such as shops/malls). where possible, the continuation of daily activities is likely to be important for population mental health as well as commercial and economic resilience. vaccination has been identifi ed in the australian plan and by the world health organization (who) as a potential strategy in the early response to pandemic infl uenza, and hence, population willingness to receive vaccination is an important factor for consideration. state pandemic vaccination plans promote use of pneumococcal vaccination and inter-pandemic (or seasonal) infl uenza vaccine for priority and at-risk groups, and the who has recommended seasonal infl uenza vaccinations for health care workers to reduce risks of genetic shifts in the avian infl uenza virus and to minimize \"background noise\" in the event of an outbreak. 4 pandemicstrain vaccination may take a number of months to supply in suffi cient quantities for population-level vaccination, however, if there was suffi cient lag in the global spread of infl uenza to australia a widespread mass vaccination of the population could become a key preventative national strategy. willingness to go into isolation or quarantine (either voluntarily or compulsorily) may also become a requirement of the containment strategy at state and national levels. a number of studies relating to public compliance with protective health behaviors have been published in recent years; including either reported levels of compliance during the outbreaks of sars and h5n1/avian infl uenza, or in anticipation of an h5n1/avian infl uenza pandemic. studies relating to behavior during or around sars outbreaks in hong kong indicated that during sars more than 90% of hong kong residents frequently wore face masks. 5, 6 following sars it was reported that 71% would wear face masks if there was a resurgence of sars. 6 however, research in singapore during sars found that only 4% of respondents in a representative population sample had worn a face mask in the preceding three days. 7 sars-related research from toronto, canada focused on compulsory quarantine and voluntary quarantine/isolation, mostly in health care workers rather than in the general population. 8, 9 compliance with compulsory quarantine was reported as high. 9 in population research fear of job/income loss was one of the most common reasons for noncompliance or for not self-quarantining. 8 in addition, the importance of good social support (friends/family) was identifi ed, due to high reliance on others for groceries and routine supplies; a need which the government was unable to meet. studies of anticipated general population compliance with protective behaviors have been undertaken in hong kong, 10, 11 norway, 12 italy, 13 the usa, 14 and, comparatively, across a number of european and asian countries. 15 in the small usa study 14 82% of participants reported that they would wear a face mask to protect others if they caught avian fl u, 78% would accept quarantine, and 84% reported that they would want vaccine to protect them from avian fl u if it were available. in the comparative europe/asia study, 15 45%-52% would limit contact with family and friends, and 24%-35% would stay indoors. in hong kong 73.8% of respondents reported that they would wear a mask in public venues and 88.3% reported that they would be fully compliant with any quarantine policies. 10 factors infl uencing uptake of protective behaviors were reported in many studies of sars, and avian infl uenza, with increased compliance often being associated with higher risk perception and anxiety, 16 concern for self/family/children, 10, 16 perceived susceptibility, 17, 18 greater knowledge regarding transmission, 13 and perceived effectiveness of protective measures. 10 with regard to demographic factors, increased adherence to protective behaviors is often associated with older age groups, female gender, higher levels of education, 10, 16 and being in full time employment. 10 studies specifi cally concerning willingness to receive vaccination in the event of a future outbreak of h5n1/avian infl uenza or in relation to sars have not been found in australia or other countries not previously affected by sars or h5n1, however, australian data relating to population willingness to receive seasonal infl uenza exists, and suggests that for those in infl uenza risk groups (over 65s, and 40s-64s meeting established research council (nh&mrc) 'at risk' criteria) infl uenza vaccination uptake is infl uenced by perceptions of risk, self rated health status and beliefs about the effi cacy of the vaccination. 19 data from hong kong indicate that rates of seasonal infl uenza vaccination have increased since sars and h5n1 and vaccination uptake behavior was linked to higher perceived likelihood of a large local outbreak of h5n1 in the future and perceptions that any future outbreak would be worse than sars had been. 17 the purpose of the current study was to gather the fi rst baseline australian data on public levels of willingness to comply with vaccination, isolation, and face mask wearing in the event of an infl uenza pandemic in australia, and to assess a selection of sociodemographic, health, and threat perception factors that might infl uence such decisions. a short six item pandemic infl uenza question module was developed, as the fi rst part of a larger module of questions on potential threats. these questions were fi eld tested, validated and subsequently administered within the nsw population health survey, using the nsw health survey program cati anticipated public health compliance for pandemic infl uenza system, between january 22nd and march 31st, 2007. the nsw population health survey includes questions on health behaviors, health status (including psychological distress, using the kessler 10 measure, 20 and self-rated health status), access to health services, as well as the demographics of the respondents and the households. the target sample was persons living in nsw stratifi ed by the state's eight area health services. households were contacted using random digit dialing. details of the sampling approach can be found in the 2007 nsw health survey report. 21 the pandemic infl uenza question module comprised three questions addressing pandemic infl uenza threat perception and three questions addressing willingness to comply with requested protective health behaviors. the latter questions are the subject of this paper, and their wording was as follows: \"in case of an emergency situation, government authorities might request co-operation from the public in a number of ways. please indicate …\" 1. how willing would you be to receive vaccination? 2. how willing would you be to isolate yourself from others if needed? 3. how willing would you be to wear a face mask? all responses were coded on a fi ve-point likert-scale. response options for all questions were 'not at all willing,' 'a little willing,' 'moderately willing,' 'very willing,' and 'extremely willing'. in addition, 'don't know' and 'refused' responses were coded. the remaining pandemic infl uenza questions on threat perception included a question on how likely respondents thought it was that there would be an infl uenza pandemic in australia, how concerned they would be that they or their family would be affected by such a pandemic, and whether they had made changes to their life because of the possibility of an infl uenza pandemic. prevalence data for these questions has been reported by barr and colleagues. 22 in this study, the threat perception questions were used as independent variables in the analysis to assess whether aspects of threat perception infl uenced anticipated compliance. the survey data were weighted to adjust for probability of selection and for differing response rates among males and females and different age groups. 21 data analysis was performed using the \"svy\" commands of stata version 9.2 (stata corp, college station, tx, usa), which allowed for adjustments for sampling weights. the fi ve-point likert-scale response used in the question module were dichotomized, such that responses of very/ extremely willing (high willingness) were coded as 1 and all other responses as 0. in addition a composite 'all' measure was calculated in which data from respondents who indicated that they would be very/extremely willing to comply with all three behaviors had their response coded as 1 and those with willingness to comply with two or fewer behaviors were coded as 0. this enabled identifi cation and analysis of a group in the sample that reported high universal willingness to comply. to assess the factors that infl uence willingness to comply with protective health behaviors, the dichotomized compliance question indicators and the 'all' indicator were used as outcome measures and these were investigated using the following set of independent variables: gender; age; marital status; have children; location (urban/rural) as defi ned by respondents' area health region; born in australia; speak a language other than english at home; living alone; employed; highest level of formal education; household income; self-rated health status; psychological distress (as determined by the kessler k10 measure, which is a composite measure with a range of 10-50 in which 'high psychological distress' has been categorized as a score ? 22 and 'low psychological distress' as a score ͻ 22); 20 and the three pandemic infl uenza threat questions (concern for self/family, pandemic likely, and life changes). multiple survey logistic regression using a stepwise backwards model was used in order to identify the factors signifi cantly associated with willingness to comply with health protective behaviors. all variables with statistical signifi cance of p յ 0.05 were retained in the fi nal model. in total 2081 state residents aged 16 and over completed the module on pandemic infl uenza. the overall response rate was 65%. the key demographics of the weighted survey were comparable to australian bureau of statistics (abs) 2006 australian population census data. 22 overall 73% of the population indicated that they would be very or extremely willing to receive vaccination, 67% would be very/extremely willing to isolate from others if needed, 58% would be very/extremely willing to wear a face mask, and 48% would be very/extremely willing to do all three. less than 8% of the population reported being 'not at all' willing to wear a face mask, and considerably lower proportions of the population were 'not at all' willing to comply with vaccination (3%) and isolation (5%). tables 1a-d present results of the survey logistic regression modeling, showing the unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio (or) for the associations between the three health protective behavior questions and the composite (all) indicator. the infl uence of age on willingness to comply with protective behaviors was found to be a key variable, and this effect is illustrated in figure 1 . generally, people reported high levels of willingness to comply with health protective behaviors in the event of pandemic infl uenza; with two thirds of the population reporting that they would be very/extremely willing to receive vaccination, two thirds reporting that they would be very/extremely willing to isolate if needed, and more than half reporting that they would be very/extremely willing to wear a face mask. although these indications of high willingness to comply may appear lower than expected, from other research studies, it should be noted that these data were collected at a time when pandemic infl uenza was not regarded as a high threat by australians; only 14% of the nsw population reported that they felt pandemic infl uenza was very or extremely likely to occur. evidence from other countries, as well as our multivariate analysis, suggest that general compliance with these behaviors would increase substantially if general concern increased, 16 although other factors, such as access to face mask, social responsibility and social acceptance, perceived effectiveness, and communication strategies would also contribute. multivariate analysis of the data indicated that the factors associated with high willingness to comply varied with each behavior, although generally, those reporting higher levels of concern that they or their families would be affected by pandemic infl uenza and those with higher levels of formal education were more likely to report high willingness to comply, and those who were younger (especially in the 16-24 year old age group) were generally less likely to report high willingness to comply. the relative importance of these factors in public health measure compliance is consistent with the fi ndings of others 10, 16 and provides helpful information to support those involved with risk communication and public health education. addressing individual behaviors, and in addition to the factors associated with high willingness to comply noted above, those with children and those with higher incomes were likely to report high willingness to receive vaccination. factors associated with lower levels of willingness to isolate oneself were speaking a language other than english at home, being younger and having never been married. these fi ndings are potentially important for those involved in disease or emergency response, and with further research to identify reasons for this lack of willingness to isolate, may suggest a need for tailored communication or support strategies. it is possible that these groups rely more on social contact outside of the household and, hence, would be less willing to forfeit this in the event of a pandemic. indications in the data show that immigrants (those not born in australia) and those who speak a language other than english at home may be less willing to isolate themselves. response to mask wearing was associated with the general factors of age, education, and concern for self/ family. however, it is the only behaviour studied here that is also associated with respondents' perceived likelihood of pandemic infl uenza occurring. mask wearing, overall, is the behavior that people reported being least willing to comply with and it is possible that, for this reason, higher threat perception (concern and likelihood of pandemic) is required to drive compliance with this behavior. younger people (16-24 and 25-34) are generally less willing to wear face masks, and only those with university qualifi cations or equivalent are signifi cantly more likely to be willing to wear face masks. in the event of a pandemic it is likely that the public will be required to wear masks, especially in health care facilities, in public places, and in situations where individuals need to interface with the public, eg, certain critical occupations such as banking, welfare, post/delivery, fuel service, and shops. the mediating effect of increased threat perception in the event of actual pandemic is likely to raise compliance but data suggest that certain sectors of the general population are likely to remain resistant to mask wearing and require further encouragement, communication strategies, and education. our analysis indicates a number of signifi cant differences between the levels of willingness to comply by respondents in differing marital status categories; most notably that those in the never married category report lower levels of willingness to comply. it should be noted, however, that there is a strong interaction with age, such that 52% of the never married category are in the 16-24 age range (76% in [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] and therefore indications of lower willingness to comply may more simply be related to age than marital status. similarly, 73% of those in the widowed category are in the 65+ age ranges. anticipated public health compliance for pandemic infl uenza worthy of mention are those factors included in the study and analysis that were not associated with willingness to comply with protective behaviors. no statistically signifi cant effects were found for gender, those living alone, employment, or psychological distress. gender and employment status have been identifi ed as determinants of health protective behaviors in some studies, 10,16 but were not found to be signifi cant here. concern for self and family, has proven to be a signifi cant factor associated with willingness to comply with protective health behaviors. this fi nding suggests that the concomitant concern/risk that would come with an actual pandemic might be suffi cient to increase public health compliance to required levels, as noted in data from hong kong during sars. 18 an alternative, more active approach might include the use of risk communication messages before a pandemic occurs, or in the pre-pandemic/increased alert stages. although the adoption of such an approach might seem compelling, middaugh in a recent paper 23 warns about the unintended consequences of raising concern over 'frightening' the public about germs, increasing concern about seasonal infl uenza (to increase take-up of vaccination) and emphasizing the role of social distancing. he argues that such approaches cause societal estrangement and frighten health care workers, fi rst responders, and those who would have contact with the public in the event of a pandemic. finally, consideration should be given to the limitations of the current study. the main limitation is that the questions are based on a hypothetical, anticipated threat to an infl uenza pandemic-naive population and, hence, serve as only a general indication of the likely response of the public to such an event. in addition, the analysis has focused on the use of dichotomized responses and has not included those who were less willing, but still may have complied with the behaviors investigated in the study. as noted, reported willingness to comply with these behaviors is likely to be mediated by a number of factors, and it is probable that only a subset of these have been identifi ed in this study. the role of threat perception, anxiety, societal response (the compliance of others), media, and factors directly related to the course of the pandemic are all likely to infl uence public response. data from this study provide the fi rst australian population baseline in this area against which future response can be tracked and pandemic modeling can be informed. this study collected data regarding anticipated responses to an infl uenza pandemic and although in the event of an actual pandemic the infl uence of age on willingness to comply with health protective behaviors. percentage shown is the proportion 'very'/'extremely' willing to comply. the overall level of compliance is likely to be infl uenced by a range of factors, it is probable that relative compliance levels within the data would be upheld and would be more robust for use in pandemic planning.

       "1  in order to contain the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) outbreak in 2003, the government in taiwan implemented numerous measures of intervention and control (kaydos-daniels et al., 2004; lee et al., 2003; twu et al., 2003) . prominent among which is the level a quarantine, implemented on march 17, for all possible contacts of suspected sars cases which eventually reached a total of 55,632 individuals quarantined, and level b quarantine, implemented on april 28, of all travelers arriving at borders from affected areas which totaled 95,828 (see table 1 in hsieh et al., 2005) . other intervention measures implemented during the outbreak include temperature monitoring, sars fever hotline, hand washing, restricted access to all medical facilities, fever screening at designated local hospitals, as well as mandatory face mask wearing while in hospitals, public transportation, and other enclosed public places, most of which were also implemented on april 28, the day after the first sars fatality had occurred in taiwan. mathematical modeling has also pinpointed the turning point of sars infections in taiwan to april 28 . it is generally acknowledged that intervention measures such as isolation of symptomatic cases and the quarantine of their traced contacts had been instrumental in controlling the past sars outbreak (chau and yip, 2003; diamond, 2003; enserink, 2003; ou et al., 2003; pang et al., 2003) . a recent modeling study (fraser et al., 2004) suggests that sars, along with smallpox, is easier to control using these simple public health measures than hiv and influenza. however, due to the current lack of evidence regarding infectivity of sars-cov prior to onset, quarantine for sars did not seem to directly prevent infections during the incubation period in the traditional sense. indeed, it has been demonstrated that quarantine served as a screening process for sars whereby previous quarantined persons who showed onset of symptoms can be more swiftly diagnosed and sufficiently isolated once onset of symptoms occurs (hsieh et al., 2005) . in view of this rather indirect effect of quarantine in preventing infections, it is important to know precisely what role did an extensive quarantine measure such as the one implemented in taiwan actually played in the eventual containment of the outbreak (ho and su, 2004) . moreover, the value of border screening and level b quarantine in deterring travel by ill persons and building public confidence remains unquantified up to now (bell, 2004) . (zhang et al., 2005) used a continuous-time compartmental model to study the impact of quarantine for sars in china. in this article we propose to use discrete time model to ascertain retrospectively and qualitatively the impact of level a and b quarantine measures in taiwan by making use of the laboratory confirmed sars case data in taiwan. the quarantine data used in this work were obtained and cleaned from the original case data in taiwan center for disease control (tcdc) sars databank (see table 1 in hsieh et al., 2005 for a summary). the sars case data contains the clinical data from onset to discharge or death and the quarantine status of 480 confirmed sars cases in taiwan, including 346 sars cases that were officially confirmed by tcdc and additional 134 laboratory confirmed sars-cov (ab+) individuals who either had milder symptoms but were not clinically diagnosed as probable cases at the time of the outbreak, or probable cases who were previously ruled-out due to false negative pcr or ab test results. these 134 cases were identified from a subsequent tcdc-sponsored large-scale seroepidemiological follow-up study to search for previously undiscovered sars cases (hsieh et al., 2005) . all seropositive cases from this study were confirmed by two different serological tests to detect anti-sars-cov antibody once discrepancies occurred. the ongoing laboratory test results of these newly laboratory confirmed cases are updated as of november of 2004. the resulting percentages of all level a and b quarantined persons who had been confirmed as sars-cov(+) cases are, respectively, 0.041% and 0.001%. the quarantine status of imported cases is given in table 1 . of the 346 officially confirmed cases in taiwan, 336 have complete clinical records from onset to discharge or death. in addition, 125 of the 134 laboratory confirmed sars-cov(+) cases have complete clinical history from onset to discharge or death. we will use the case data of these 461 (336+125) confirmed cases with time of onsets between february 25 and june 25 for our modeling study (see fig. 1 ). note that one suicide case was also excluded from the case data used. we consider a susceptible-infective-removal (sir) model (flow diagram in fig. 2 ) similar to the linear model in , but with additional compartments for levels a and b quarantined persons (respective variables a n and b n ), and for the previously quarantined infectives (j n ). hospitalized cases (h n ) mean those who were diagnosed and hospitalized as a suspected sars case, while the probable cases (p n ) are ones who has been classified as a probable sars case according to the case definition of (world health organization, 2003a). note that the subscript n has been deleted in fig. 2 for brevity. the detailed model description is given as follows: model variables: s n the number of susceptible individuals at time t ¼ n a n the number of level a quarantined infected persons at time t ¼ n b n the number of level b quarantined infected persons at time t ¼ n i n the number of infective (symptomatic) sars cases at time t ¼ n not previously quarantined j n the number of previously quarantined infective (symptomatic) sars cases at time t ¼ n h n the number of hospitalized suspected cases at time t ¼ n p n the number of probable cases at time t ¼ n r n the cumulative number of discharged sars cases at time t ¼ n d n the cumulative number of sars deaths at time t ¼ n c 1 (n) number of imported cases not quarantined when entering at time t ¼ n c 2 (n) number of imported cases quarantined when entering at time t ¼ n note that time unit is in days. (1) the number of imported susceptible persons and birth during the outbreak are small compared to the total susceptible population (s). (2) a person is moved out of susceptible class only after onset of symptoms and/or quarantine. (3) an infective person can infect others at either infective (i and j) or hospitalized (h) stages. (4) a hospitalized case is removed either by reclassification to probable sars case or death. (5) a probable case is removed either by discharge or death. q quarantined rate of infected persons g j , j ¼ 1, 2 onset rate of levels a and b quarantined persons, respectively m j , j ¼ 1, 2 hospitalization rate of unquarantined and previously quarantined infective cases, respectively o rate of reclassification to probable cases s discharge rate of probable sars persons r 1 fatality rate of hospitalized sars cases r 2 fatality rate of probable sars cases l n incidence rate at time n b constant infection rate due to contact with an infective case (i) g constant infection rate due to contact with a hospitalized case (h) z constant infection rate due to contact with a previous quarantined infective case (j) the model equations with time unit in day then follows: note that we use a simple linear model instead of a nonlinear model with standard incidence or mass action since, in a small outbreak like sars in 2003, the total susceptible population remained relatively unchanged. also note that, theoretically, it is conceivable for q to be greater than 1 in a hypothetical scenario of highly efficient contact tracing and quarantine program. however, our aim is to study 2003 sars outbreak retrospectively where we knew the quarantine was much less efficient in reality. the parameter estimation for the model was carried out by fitting the time series of 361 confirmed sars case data to the model using three-stage least-squares (3sls) method, commonly used in econometrics for estimating multiple parameters of simultaneous equations (pindyck and rubinfeld, 1998) . the detailed description of the 3sls estimation procedure is given in the appendix. to simplify the estimation, we will make use of previously published estimates of the model parameters for taiwan sars, whenever available. in hsieh et al. (2005) , the mean onsetto-diagnosis times for quarantined and unquarantined individuals were computed from the taiwan sars case data to be 1.20 days and 2.89 days, respectively, hence we obtain m 2 ¼ 1/1.2 ¼ 0.833 and m 1 ¼ 1/2.89 ¼ 0.346 for the respective removal rates of the quarantine and unquarantined infective. moreover, also from the result in hsieh et al. (2005), we can obtain o ¼ 1/7.55 ¼ 0.132 for the reclassification rate of the hospitalized persons. the estimates for the model parameters are given in table 2 along with their respective p-values for the t-tests used to determine whether each parameter is significantly different from zero (statistical details relating to p-values obtained here are also given in the supplementary information). the infections by the previously quarantined persons j n and hospitalized patients h n (g and z) were determined by the model to be not significantly different from zero when compared with the infection during infective stages i n and hence omitted from table 2 . we proceed to describe the important epidemiological parameters and results which we can deduce from the estimation. from the estimates we are able to obtain the average case fatality ratio for a sars probable case conditional on death or recovery which is given by the simple formula: where r 2 is the fatality of a probable case and d is the discharge rate. that is, given that a probable case has only two possible outcomes of recovery or death, the chance of fatality is approximately one in nine, which is lower than the cumulative case fatality ratios (deaths/case number) reported in affected regions (table 3 , world health organization, 2003b). the average daily quarantine rate for level a quarantine is estimated to be q ¼ 0.047 [95%ci: 0.0280-0.0677], which is the average rate at which potential candidates for quarantine (i.e. the asymptomatic exposed persons) on any particular day are in fact being quarantined. in other words, during this period one out of every 21 asymptomatic individuals who should be quarantined was indeed quarantined. moreover, it is not significantly the weighted r-square for the estimation is r 2 ¼ 0.9983. a p-value of 1àm 1 +b(1àq). b p-value of qb. different from the overall quarantine rate of 0.05 (24 quarantined cases out of 480 total cases). we can further make use of the results to explore the effectiveness of the quarantine implemented. for illustration, we let the quarantine rate for level a quarantine q vary between 0 and 1, where q ¼ 0 means no quarantine and q ¼ 1 implies swift quarantine of locally exposed persons, i.e. everyone potentially exposed and should be quarantined on any particular day is being quarantined 24 h after exposure, on the average. we then compute the theoretical numbers of sars cases and deaths using the model and designated value of q. table 3 gives the resulting percentage of increase or reduction in the total numbers of sars cases and deaths. the result indicates that the level a quarantine for sars in taiwan with 0.047 quarantine rate (which yields theoretical numbers of 569 cases and 99 deaths) had prevented approximately 461 cases (81%) and 62 deaths (63%), while a swift quarantine of q ¼ 1, where everyone locally exposed and should be quarantined was quarantined on the first day, would have reduced both the case number and fatality by over 86%, or only 68 totally cases and 14 deaths. note that in this theoretical scenario, the case number of 68 includes 35 imported cases, of which only one had been quarantined on arrival. subsequently, local transmission by these unquarantined imported cases after onset contributes to the additional cases. moreover, infective cases with minimum incubation time of 1 day (onset within 1 day of exposure) had been reported in china as well as singapore (world health organization, 2003b), further leading to the possibility of local transmission by these locally infected cases before quarantine. only q-n implies quarantine for every locally exposed individual immediately after exposure, which would prevent all cases except those 35 imported cases mentioned above and their first level infecteds of those unquarantined on arrival. we proceed in similar fashion with regard to level b quarantine by computing the theoretical increase in the numbers of sars cases and deaths if the single quarantined imported case had not been quarantined, as well the reductions if the unquarantined imported cases had been quarantined. table 4 gives the results of this theoretical study. first we study the impact of one imported case who arrived from china on may 2 via sea but was not quarantined even though, starting on april 28, full-scale quarantine of all border arrivals from china were required to be home quarantined for 14 days. failure to quarantine this individual, who had onset of symptoms on may 7 and was diagnosed and hospitalized the next day, resulted in approximately 12 cases and 2 death (row 1). moreover, if level b quarantine had been implemented from the beginning of the outbreak and all imported cases were successfully quarantined at the border, it would result in 49% reduction in cases and in sars fatality (row 2). there were only two successful quarantined (level b) imported cases, both arriving from china. the first was quarantined on arrival on march 28, developed symptoms on april 1 and was diagnosed as suspected case and table 3 theoretical impact of level a quarantine on case number and fatality with various hypothetical quarantine rates q as compared with quarantine rate of q ¼ 0.047 estimated from the model the percentage increase or reduction is given in parenthesis. + denotes additional cases, à denotes reduction in cases. the percentage increase or reduction from theoretical numbers of cases or death using the present model is given in parenthesis. + denotes additional cases, à denotes reduction in cases. quarantined on april 2. our simulation shows that if this successful quarantine of this imported case had not occurred, it would result in approximately 17 cases and three deaths (row 3). the second quarantined imported case was quarantined on arrival on may 6, had onset of symptoms on may 8 and was diagnosed and hospitalized immediately. quarantine of this case prevented approximately 12 additional cases and two death (row 4). quarantine of the earlier case is only slightly more impactful. the combined effect of these two quarantined cases prevented 29 cases and five deaths (row 5). the combined effect of all quarantines reduced the case number and fatality almost by half (last row). (1) in a fast spreading infectious disease with unknown or uncertain knowledge of the etiological agent, the effectiveness and efficiency of control efforts are of the highest priority. the quarantine rate q gives a measure of the efficiency, or the speed, at which a potential level a quarantine case is actually being quarantined. thus quarantine rate of 0.047 estimated over the time period 2/25-6/25 indicates that, on a daily basis, only one out of every 21 exposed persons who should be quarantined was actually quarantined. this reflects the need for more efficient real-time contact tracing during the outbreak in order to seek out potential infected persons for quarantine, observation, and swift diagnosis when onset of symptoms occurs. one should note, however, that the data used includes many mild cases that were not clinically diagnosed and hence their exposed contacts were not traceable. this would result in a significantly lower quarantine rate than the one computed from using clinically diagnosed sars cases only. hence the efficiency of contact tracing and quarantine is also dependent on correct diagnosis of symptomatic infective individuals, which could be severely lacking in the early stages of a newly emerging disease such as witnessed during the past sars outbreak. (2) the contribution to infections by the previously quarantined (j n ) and hospitalized (h n ) persons appeared to be insignificant when compared with the infection by the infectives in i n . this does not mean infections by j n and h n had not occurred, merely that their effects were relatively insignificant. in fact, 80% of the officially confirmed sars cases in taiwan were acquired in hospitals (ho and su, 2004) , but the many of them occurred prior to the patients' hospitalization as a suspected sars case, while they were in outpatient clinics, observation rooms, and emergency rooms, sometimes for other illness, where the patients often stayed for hours and sometimes for days before being moved (jiang et al., 2003a, b) . many of those infected were also in the hospital as healthcare workers, hospital staff, and visitors. this also indicates that, in term of intervention, rapid initial detection is much more important than subsequent classification of probable cases. (3) by comparison, a perfect level a quarantine (which aimed to quarantine all asymptomatic cases as soon as they were potentially exposed) results in more drastic reduction of cases than a perfect level b quarantine. however, it is intuitive that if all imported cases were effectively isolated, there would be no local outbreak. indeed, from our result the timeliness of level b quarantine is important, as indicated by the difference in the reduction of cases by the two quarantined imported cases. given the controversial nature of fullscaled quarantine of international travelers, appropriate mathematical modeling is required to provide evidence-based criterion for public health authority to determine its swift implementation. the difficulty and scope involved in a successful quarantine, as quantified in tables 3 and 4 , gives strong indication that quarantine must be combined with other intervention measures for successful and swift containment of an outbreak. the results also corroborate with previous studies of intervention measures for sars outbreak where hospital-wide case isolation is found to be more important than quarantine (see e.g., day et al., 2006; gumel et al., 2004; lloyd-smith et al., 2003; webb et al., 2004) . (4) the simulation results in tables 3 and 4 highlight the effect an efficient quarantine measure could have on significantly reducing the magnitude of the outbreak. we emphasize, however, that the numbers of reduction and increase in cases and deaths shown in tables 3 and  4 are not to be taken literally, but to be consider qualitatively as a measure of the magnitude of the effect brought on by the various hypothetical scenarios for the purpose of comparing different control measures. however, there is ample evidence that superspreading events had played a significant role in the 2003 outbreaks (li et al., 2004; riley et al., 2003) which was not singled out in our model. (5) finally, the effect of public response to outbreak and behavior change to prevent infection is most difficult to quantify. question remains as to how one can pinpoint the degree of effectiveness or the relative importance of different measures implemented. one may never know for certain how important temperature monitoring or hand washing had been to the containment of the outbreak, or what role, if any, did mandatory face mask wearing in public transportation systems play, or whether the decrease in infection rate is merely due to the psychological effect of outbreak and the subsequent behavior change by the general population to simply try to stay home and avoid contacts-especially since multiple prevention measures were co-operating at the same time in blocking all possible channels of the transmission of sars-cov. one thing is certain, all of these intervention measures and the subsequent in-dividual behavior changes combined to prevent the past sars epidemic from being more catastrophic than it was, and will be our best defense when the next emerging infectious disease approaches. yhh and cck are supported by national science council of taiwan (grants nsc 93-2751-b005-001-y and nsc 93-2751-b002-020-y). yhh would like to thank mitacs (canada) for their generous financial support for yhh to attend the mitacs sars meetings at banff, canada, where several of the above-mentioned discussions took place. the authors thank three anonymous referees for constructive comments which helped to improve this manuscript significantly. the authors also would like to extend our sincere gratitude to public health personnel at tcdc and local health departments for their dedicated efforts in the prevention and control measures during 2003 sars outbreak. appendix. parameter estimation procedure to estimate the model parameters, we treat a linear system of equations a multi-equation simulation model, which allows us to account for the interrelationship within a set of variables, namely, a n , b n , j n , i n , h n , p n , and d n , which are called endogenous variables in econometrics (pindyck and rubinfeld, 1998) . two-stage least-squares (2sls) and three-stage least squares (3sls) can both provide a very useful estimation procedure for simultaneous equation. however, 2sls is inefficient when the system of equations contains lagged dependent variables, which account for adjustments that take place over time. we can achieve a gain in efficiency by applying 3sls. it involves applying generalized least-squares estimation to a system of equations, each of which has first been estimated using 2sls. the 3sls procedure, also used for the parameter estimation in the simpler linear model in , yields more efficient parameter estimates than does 2sls because it takes into account the cross-equation correlation and hence is utilized here for parameter estimation. furthermore, we make use of the 3sls subroutine in sas package to estimate the model parameters. we add an error term in each equation when we employ 3sls to estimate the unknown parameters. moreover, to perform hypothesis tests for our model, we assume that the error terms follow a gaussian distribution in order to test whether each parameter is significantly different from zero. we would like to test for h 0 :b ¼ 0 (null hypotheses) versus h 1 :b6 ¼0 (alternative hypotheses). large value of t-statistic or small value of p-value leads to conclude that h 1 :b6 ¼0. the p-value is less than the specified level of significant a ¼ 0.05, we could conclude h a directly. the last column of tables 2 and 3 give the p-values for the estimations, indicating that the data are not consistent with b ¼ 0. note that the p-value is sometimes called the observed level of significance, with which one can conduct a test at any desired level of significance a by comparing the p-value with the specified level a.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "2  acute viral respiratory tract infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in children, particularly those with compromised immune systems [1] [2] [3] . nucleic acid amplification tests have shown their superiority over classical diagnostic methods, such as direct fluorescent antibody detection (dfa) and viral isolation, in identifying a broader range of viruses, with higher sensitivity and specificity [4] [5] [6] . recently, several studies have demonstrated the advantages of multiplex pcr for simultaneous detection of a panel of viruses in one assay [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . in this study we compared (i) the sensitivity and specificity of four commercial multiplex pcr assays with dfa and viral isolation for detection of respiratory viruses in children, and (ii) the sensitivity of two assays, resplex ii plus pre and seeplex influenza a/b subtyping, with the astra influenza screen & type assay and dfa for detection of h1 and h3 seasonal and pandemic h1n1 2009 influenza a virus. multiplex assays. seven hundred and fifty nasopharyngeal (np) swabs were selected from children (birth to 17 years) with suspected respiratory tract infection seen at the hospital for sick children (toronto, canada). the first 25 specimens received each week for a 24-week period (november 2007 to april 2008), were selected, for a total of 600 specimens, without knowing results of dfa or viral isolation. an additional 150 specimens were chosen in the same manner (january 2009 to march 2009). nasopharyngeal swabs (flocked swabs; copan diagnostics, murrieta, ca, usa) were inoculated into 3 ml of universal transport medium (utm-rt copan diagnostics, murrieta, ca, usa). after vortexing, specimens from 2007/2008 (n = 600) were dispensed into four 400-ll aliquots and stored at )80°c until nucleic acid extraction, whereas specimens from 2009 (n = 150) were submitted to nucleic acid extraction before aliquoting and freezing at )80°c. specimen selection for comparison of assays to detect seasonal influenza a and pandemic h1n1 2009 influenza. a total of 130 np swab specimens were selected from aliquots of the original specimens frozen at )80°c on receipt: 75 influenza a positive specimens by astra screen and type assay (13 seasonal influenza a (infa)-h1, 12 infa-h3 and 50 pandemic h1n1 2009 influenza a (infa)-h1n1), and 55 influenza a/b negative specimens by the astra assay. all specimens were made anonymous and de-linked from all personal health identifiers. dfa was performed using fluorophore-labelled monoclonal antibodies against respiratory syncytial virus (rsv), parainfluenza viruses 1-3 (piv), adenovirus (adv), infa/b (simulfluor ò ; millipore, temecula, ca, usa) and human metapneumovirus (hmpv) (diagnostic hybrids, athens, oh, usa). dfa was carried out for each target as per the manufacturer's protocol. amplification products were detected using the liquichip 200 (luminex 200) (austin, tx, usa) for resplex ii v2.0, and the luminex 100 for rvp and rvp fast. qiagen instructs each user to determine appropriate cut-off values for their testing platform and patient population. cut-off values for resplex ii v2.0 were determined empirically to be the sum of the mean mfi plus ‡5 times the standard deviation of negative specimens (negative in all assays). the cut-off values for rvp and rvp fast were predetermined by the manufacturer. each assay had an internal control (ic) included to rule out pcr inhibition. table 1 shows the targets and characteristics of each multiplex assay. to detect amplification products, the seeplex rv15 assay was coupled with capillary electrophoresis technology (lab901screen tape system; lab901 ltd, loanhead, uk). true positive. for all targets except piv4, bov, coronaviruses, enterovirus and rhinovirus, any positive viral culture or a positive result for a single target from any two of dfa and the four molecular assays was considered true positive. because piv4, bov, coronaviruses, enterovirus and rhinovirus could not be detected by dfa or viral isolation, a true positive for these agents was defined as a positive result in at least two of the three or four multiplex pcr assays. distribution of respiratory viruses. virus isolation was performed on 684 specimens. of 750 specimens tested, 502 (66.9%) were considered true positive results for at least one virus by dfa, culture or pcr; 288/750 (38.4%) specimens were positive by dfa or viral isolation, while an additional 214 (28.5%) were positive by multiplex pcr. a single virus was detected in 420 specimens (83.7%), two viruses in 77 (15.3%), three in four specimens (0.8%) and four viruses in one (0.2%). table 2 shows the overall distribution of respiratory viral pathogens, indicating the predominance of enteroviruses/rhinoviruses, influenza viruses and rsv. it also shows that parainfluenza viruses, hmpv and coronaviruses accounted for about 7% each, followed by bocavirus and adenovirus at around 4% each. among dual infections (n = 77) entero/rhinoviruses were most commonly associated with other viruses. triple virusinfected specimens included adv + enterovirus/rhinovirus + bov (n = 1), piv4 + adv + enterovirus/rhinovirus (n = 1), rsvb + nl63 + bov (n = 1) and rsvb + piv4 + enterovirus/rhinovirus (n = 1). the unique quadruple-agent infected specimen was piv3 + nl63 + enterovirus/rhinovirus + bov (n = 1). comparison of sensitivity and specificity among assays. sensitivity and specificity were calculated for each target and assay according to our definition of a true and false positive (tables 3 and 4) . some viral targets were lumped together as necessary to perform a sensitivity and specificity analysis (i.e. entero/rhinovirus, coronaviruses). table 3 indicates that dfa and culture were, as expected, less sensitive than pcr for most targets. however, dfa was more sensitive than pcr for a small number of specific targets and assays (i. among all the multiplex assays tested, seeplex rv15 was the most sensitive for detecting all targets except for enteroviruses and rhinoviruses. all multiplex assays had good sensitivity for the detection of influenza a (93.7-98.4%). influenza b sensitivity was good in all multiplex assays (100%) except for rvp fast (64.9%). the superior performance of seeplex rv15 for rsv (100% sensitivity) reflected strong performance for both rsva and rsvb, whereas the decreased sensitivity of other assays reflected a weaker performance for either target (i.e. resplex ii v2.0: rsva 90.4%, rsvb 79.3%, and rvp: rsva 85.5%, rsvb 98.3%). similarly, variability in the sensitivity of individual targets of the four parainfluenza viruses resulted in variation in the overall sensitivity. again, seeplex rv15 showed good sensitivity for all four types (85.7-100%), while resplex ii v2.0 had reduced sensitivity for piv4 (60%), rvp had reduced sensitivity for piv1 (71.4%) and 3 (71.4%), and rvp fast had reduced sensitivity for piv1 (46.7%), 2 (77.8%) and 3 (42.8%). sensitivity for detecting hmpv was good for seeplex rv15, rvp and rvp fast (92.3-97.4%), and acceptable for resplex ii v2.0 (82%). however, performance for adenovirus, an important respiratory pathogen, was very variable, ranging from 52.4% (rvp fast) to 100% (seeplex rv15), probably reflecting the variation in serotype coverage among the assays. of the additional viral agents tested in the multiplex assays, the coronaviruses were consistently detected across all assays except for cov oc43 by rvp (53.8%) and cov hku1 by rvp fast (16.7%). seeplex rv15 and rvp fast detected 100% of bocavirus infections, while the sensitivity of resplex ii v2.0 was only 75%. detection of enterovirus and rhinovirus was the most inconsistent. although the specific targets for each multiplex assay are proprietary, it is known that the highly conserved regions of the 5¢ntr region of either rhinoviruses or enteroviruses, will also amplify members of the other genus. thus, some assays, such as the rvp and rvp fast assays, have combined the enterovirus and rhinovirus targets, because developing specific targets for each genus outside of the 5¢ntr region may compromise sensitivity of detection, especially of the rhinoviruses. this is possibly the case with the seeplex rv15 assay, which separates enteroviruses and rhinoviruses, but has a lower sensitivity than the other assays. though the resplex ii v2.0 assay differentiates between enteroviruses and rhinoviruses, the occurrence of 38.4% of positive specimens testing positive for both targets, suggests that there may be cross-reactivity between them. specificity was excellent for all assays, using our composite reference standard. without using individual single-plex assays to adjudicate the single test positives, we cannot determine whether the slightly lower specificity observed for a few targets in several assays was due to higher sensitivity of detection or detection of false positives. multiplexed respiratory panels provide clinicians with more diagnostic and treatment information for managing patients. in the case of influenza a, knowledge of the subtype is important with respect to predicting the activity of antiviral agents such as the adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors. in addition to increased sensitivity and number of viruses detected, multiplex assays permit the improved identification of cases of infection with multiple agents, which may be clinically significant, especially in immune compromised individuals. in our study, we found that two or more viruses were present in 10.9% of specimens (16.3% of positive specimens). bocavirus and coronaviruses were the viruses most commonly associated with multiple agent infection, followed by human metapneumovirus, the parainfluenza viruses, adenovirus and the entero/rhinoviruses. influenza a/b and rsv were the least likely to be detected in the presence of another virus. the role of multiple viral agents in affecting the clinical course of disease is at present unknown and worthy of further study. with respect to the technical performance of the different multiplex assays, the following issues were identified: seeplex rv15 was designed as a two-step rt-pcr format necessitating a separate rt (cdna) assay, though a new one-step procedure has been developed. it was the only assay that required three pcr master mixes with five targets in each one plus the internal control. it was also the only assay that incorporated positive controls for all 15 viral targets, which is considered an additional quality control feature of the assay. seeplex rv15 was the assay with the shortest post-pcr step, especially for a small number of specimens when using the lab 901 screen tape ò system (maximum five specimens per run). in contrast, the resplex ii v2.0, rvp and rvp fast use a 96-well microtitre plate format on the luminex platform, permitting high throughput analysis. practical considerations in most laboratories regarding the feasibility and the direct and indirect costs of introducing multiplex molecular testing for respiratory viruses have led to a relatively slow routine implementation of this methodology. mahony et al. [15] have shown that rvp employed as the first-line diagnostic tool in children was the least costly strategy, compared with dfa and culture, dfa alone or dfa plus rvp, when the prevalence of infection was ‡11%. the cost of molecular testing is offset by its more efficient use of labour than conventional dfa and culture and by savings to the healthcare system when additional testing and hospitalization can be avoided by knowledge of a test result with high sensitivity and specificity. operationally, molecular methods also allow virology laboratories to continue to function, even in the event that viral culture cannot be carried out due to biosafety issues. in our study, newer assays or versions of the multiplex assays (resplex ii plus panel pre (21 targets) and seeplex influenza a/b subtyping (six targets)) showed good sensitivity and specificity relative to a tri-plex influenza real-time rt-pcr (astra influenza screen & type) for pandemic h1n1 2009 infa virus detection. this is important, as traditional seasonal h1 subtyping molecular assays will not react with the pandemic strain and it is expected that the 2009 pandemic strain may become the predominant circulating seasonal h1 strain in the immediate post-pandemic period. we have shown that multiplex pcr increases the sensitivity of detection of respiratory viruses in children by 74.3% over dfa and viral isolation, while maintaining excellent specificity. however, it will be important to develop more effective clinical and laboratory algorithms for their timely and optimal use and to study their impact on patient care in different populations in different clinical settings. influenza, rsv, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus and hmpv have been well established as leading causes of respiratory infection among infants and children [16] [17] [18] . however, the role of rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, bocavirus and coronaviruses as copathogens in upper respiratory tract infection or as agents of lower respiratory tract infection, has been less well investigated, and will be aided by studies using this technology [19] .

       "3  the name 'nipah' comes from a malaysian village, where the first outbreak was reported in 1998-1999 (1, 2) . the outbreak of nipah virus (niv) disease in malaysia involved more than 250 cases of febrile encephalitis in farm and abattoir workers. this outbreak caused widespread panic and considerable socioeconomic disruption. although, no further outbreaks were reported from malaysia the virus has been responsible for outbreaks in other parts of the world, mainly in bangladesh and india (2) . recent outbreak of nipah virus in kerala in may 2018 brought this emerging-re-emerging virus into the spotlight again. the high mortality rate, broad species tropism, multiple plausible modes of transmission, risk of person-person transmission and documented cases of health care workers being affected during outbreaks has left the medical community perplexed. while a lot remains to be deciphered about the virus and many efforts to unravel its mysteries are ongoing, this article has tried to review and synthesize the available information about this virus and its clinical aspects. the clinical information presented in this article can be used as a guiding tool for physicians in an outbreak setting. nipah virus is an enveloped paramyxovirus with negative-stranded polarity and a non-segmented rna genome consisting of helical nucleocapsids. niv has subtle differences in its makeup when compared to a typical paramyxovirus. it has reticular cytoplasmic inclusions close to the endoplasmic reticulum unlike other paramyxoviruses. also, niv is on average larger than typical paramyxoviruses. there are only minor ultrastructural differences between hendra virus (hev) and niv and they have significant cross reactivity on serological tests, and are therefore grouped as henipavirus (3) . within niv, two different strains have been identified, the malaysian (my) and the bangladesh (bd) strains. the two strains are approximately 92% identical on sequencing but appear to be significantly different in their pathogenicity and transmissibility (4-7). the first outbreak of nipah virus in malaysia-singapore (1998) (1999) was initially thought to be japanese encephalitis (je), however on further investigation, it was later identified as nipah virus ( figure 1 ) (3, 8, 9) . the second outbreak of this disease was in a geographically non-contiguous location, in the meherpur district of bangladesh and siliguri city of west bengal, india in 2001 (figures 1 and 2) . the indo-bangladesh outbreaks were significantly different from the previous outbreak in malaysia in terms of modes of transmission, clinical features and case fatality rates. human to human transmission and nosocomial infections (via droplets and/or fomites) were a prominent feature in this outbreak. also, the secondary attack rates were higher and the disease was more severe and rapidly progressive compared to the malaysian outbreak. apart from the neurological manifestations, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) and respiratory failure with multi organ dysfunction syndrome (mods) were probably the major reason for higher mortality. since then, there has been an outbreak in bangladesh almost every year and a total of 17 outbreaks have been reported until 2015. there was another small outbreak in 2007 in the nadia district of west bengal, india (figures 1 and 2 ). in the outbreak in the philippines in march-may, 2014, both horses and humans were affected with fruit bats being the possible source of infection. interestingly, this outbreak was significantly associated with horse slaughter and horse meat consumption (figures 1 and 2 ) (10) . the indian outbreak of 2018 affected primarily the kozhikode district and nearby area of kerala (figures 1  and 2 ) (11) . the malaysian outbreak was primarily due to close contact with affected pigs. no human to human transmission was reported (8, 12, 13) . the indo-bangladesh outbreaks, including the recent kerala outbreak, was remarkable in various aspects, mode of transmission being one of them. a significant association of niv disease and consumption of raw date palm sap contaminated by fruit bats was found by luby et al. (14) another study by rahman et al. also concluded with similar results (15) . in date palm sap the virus remains stable for at least 7 days at 22°c and is extremely tolerant to a wide range of ph (from 3 to 11) (16) . human to human and nosocomial transmission was also documented in the indo-bangladesh outbreaks. in the siliguri outbreak of 2001, a single patient admitted to a private hospital infected 23 hospital staff and 8 visitors (17) . poor adherence to standard precautions was probably the major reason for this. also, the difference in strains (bd vs. my) contributed to the difference in the transmission rates. a study by clayton et al. showed that ferrets infected with the bd strain had higher rna levels in the blood as well as increased shedding of the virus in oral secretions, possibly explaining the higher secondary attack rates as well as more severe infection in the indo-bangladesh outbreak. it is noteworthy that viral shedding was seen even in the incubation period (18) . the major research findings in different studies are tabulated in table 1 . clinical features of nipah typically includes fever with encephalitis and or respiratory involvement ( figure  3 ) (17, (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) . asymptomatic infection was reported in 8% of patients with laboratory-confirmed cases in malaysia. no such data of asymptomatic niv infection sensorium was the most common presentation. a case series of four outbreaks from bangladesh shows altered mental status (90%), headache (73%), severe weakness (67%) and seizures (23%) as common neurological manifestation (17) . nipah encephalitis may present with relapse or residual deficits in survivors. relapse of encephalitis has been demonstrated with a time range of months to years after recovery from acute infection. psychiatric and neurological complications (depression, personality changes, deficits in attention, verbal, and/ or visual memory) after recovery are also well known. goh et al. reports from their malaysian outbreak experience that 15 percent of their patients (14 patients) had residual deficits out of which five remained in a vegetative state (19) . respiratory involvement is well documented in severe cases. ards (50% to 66% cases) was documented in malaysian outbreak. siliguri outbreak witnessed 54 percent cases had associated respiratory symptoms particularly in the later stage of illness. is available from bangladesh and indian outbreaks. however, cases with mild and nonspecific features were identified. fever, headache, dizziness, myalgia, vomiting and loose stools have been documented as non-specific prodromal symptoms in various outbreaks of nipah. the malaysian outbreak documented that 55 percent of patients had a reduced level of consciousness and prominent brain-stem dysfunction (10) . distinctive clinical signs included segmental myoclonus (32%), areflexia, hypotonia, hypertension, and tachycardia and thus suggests the involvement of the brain stem and upper cervical spinal cord. brain stem dysfunction and neurological clinical signs include abnormal doll's eye reflex, reflexes, vasomotor changes, and myoclonic jerks. cerebellar dysfunction was seen in eight patients in the malaysian outbreak. in siliguri outbreak (2001) in india, fever followed by altered sensorium (97%) developing over the next 3 to 4 days was the presenting complaint. 34 percent of the cases had convulsions (20) . similarly, in bangladesh outbreaks, fever with altered s i g n i f i c a n t r e s p i r a t o r y involvement leading to ards in bangladesh strain of niv. --serology is cross reactive to hendra. ----respiratory involvement and higher mortality in bangladesh strain, compared to malaysia strain. major finding related to therapeutic options ribavirin can substantially reduce m o r t a l i t y ( 3 6 % ) w i t h o u t a n y significant adverse reactions. in vitro activity of ribavirin on halting the replication of niv in cell cultures. role of monoclonal antibody m102.4 in preventing transmission and halting disease progression among animal model of ferrets and african green monkey. promising role of favipiravir in protecting niv infected animals (hamster model). common hematologic abnormalities in niv infection include thrombocytopenia (30%) and leukopenia (11%) ( table 2) . elevated liver enzymes have been seen in 40% of patients, and hyponatraemia is sometimes found. hemoglobin, renal indices and electrolytes other than sodium are usually normal. lymphocytic pleocytosis with raised proteins similar to any other viral meningitis may be seen in cerebrospinal fluid. niv is a biosafety level (bsl) 4 agent, however, bsl 2 laboratory facilities are sufficient for routine diagnosis if the virus is inactivated during specimen collection and isolation is not attempted. laboratory diagnosis of a patient with a clinical history of niv can be made during the acute and convalescent phases of the disease by using a combination of tests. samples should be transported at 4°c and processed as early as possible. during the early stage of illness -virus isolation and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay (rt pcr) from throat and nasal swabs, cerebrospinal fluid (csf), urine, and blood is recommended (24) . during the convalescent phase, antibody detection by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa-igg and igm) from serum or csf may be used. advanced diffusion weighted (dw) magnetic resonance imaging (mri) of the brain can give useful radiological evidence of nipah encephalitis. lim et al. suggested that mri pattern may be useful in differentiating nipah from its closely differential related japanese encephalitis/other encephalitis in most cases (25) . it can also help to diagnose exposed individuals, particularly at the height of an epidemic even before serologic confirmation is available (19) . this finding derived from malaysian experience during nipah outbreak needs validation from other occurrences. more experience is required for its validation but this can be a potentially crucial finding to diagnose nipah encephalitis and decide treatment and post exposure prophylaxis. mri in acute nipah encephalitis shows multifocal discrete lesions probably due to areas of micro-infarction. these discrete high-signal-intensity lesions usually measure about 2-7 mm and are disseminated throughout the brain, mainly in the subcortical and deep white matter of the cerebral hemispheres. mass effect or edema is not usually seen. in relapse or late onset nipah encephalitis, mri characteristically shows multiple areas of patchy and confluent cortical involvement (26,27). nipah is an important differential diagnosis in patients with fever and encephalitis and/or ards in context of relevant epidemiology with an ongoing outbreak in the area or relevant travel history to affected areas. but any fever or encephalitis may mimic disease and differentials need to be seen in correct perspective. the following differentials should be considered in patients with suspected nipah infection: a) japanese encephalitis (je), b) measles, c) rabies, d) dengue encephalitis, e) cerebral malaria, f) scrub typhus, g) leptospirosis, h) herpes encephalitis and i) bacterial meningitis (table 3) . treatment of niv disease is mostly limited to supportive (28) . under the current circumstances, specific pharmacological options should not be treated as alternatives to infection control measures. more evidence needs to be generated for considering postexposure prophylaxis in individuals who were in close contact with confirmed nipah cases. however, three pharmacological options have been explored for the possible treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis of niv infection: ribavirin, m102.4 monoclonal antibody and favipiravir. in vitro studies and animal studies have shown conflicting results in the efficacy of ribavirin against niv and hendra, with some studies showing effective inhibition of viral replication in cell lines (29, 30) , whereas some studies in animal models showed that ribavirin treatment only delayed but did not prevent death after nipah or hendra virus infection (31, 32) . only one in-vivo human study by chong et al. has evaluated the role of ribavirin during the malaysia outbreak of niv, between 1998 and 1999 (33) . in this study, patients who were managed prior to the availability of ribavirin during the outbreak or who refused ribavirin were taken as controls, and all patients who were still in the acute phase of the illness were offered ribavirin, either oral or intravenous, based on availability. a total of 140 patients treated with ribavirin were retrospectively compared with 52 control niv patients who did not receive ribavirin due to unavailability and 2 patients who didn't consent there was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse reactions in the treatment group as compared to controls. the study showed 45 deaths in the treated group (32%) and 29 in the controls (54%), with a total of 36% reduction in mortality. however, as treatment allocation was not randomized, it is possible that treated patients had better clinical outcomes because they received better general medical care than the untreated patients. the dosage of ribavirin in nipah virus has not been defined but treatment can be initiated in the lines of that suggested by who for lassa fever with a loading dose of 30 mg/kg for children and 2,000 mg/kg for adults, followed by 10 days of therapy (4 g in divided doses for first four days and 2 g in divided doses for next six days). oral bioavailability of ribavirin is reported to be between 32.6% and 52%, with evidence of first-pass metabolism. ribavirin is not bound to plasma proteins (34) . ribavirin was found to cross the blood-brain barrier following oral administration with a mean csf/plasma ratio of 0.7 (35) . the serious adverse drug reactions with ribavirin are: neutropenia (8% to 40%), anemia (11% to 35%; children & adolescents: 11%), lymphocytopenia (12% to 14%) and suicidal ideations (36) . most of the side-effects with ribavirin have been noticed with long term administration. ribavirin has been found to be teratogenic in animal studies on rodents and rabbits, but no human teratogenic studies are available. due to the long terminal half-life of elimination of the drug, the minimum interval following treatment with ribavirin before pregnancy can be safely initiated is estimated to be 7 months (36) . the infectious diseases society of america has recommended in 2008 the use of ribavirin in cases of niv infections (37) . owing to the positive in-vivo and in-vitro results and a considerable safety profile for short term courses, a strong case can be made favoring short course high dose ribavirin for therapy. however, a controlled trial is lacking to resolve the status, for which a pre-approval should be taken from the appropriate authority, so that the trial may be immediately started with the onset of a future outbreak. the experimental monoclonal antibody, m102.4, which targets the ephrin-b2 and ephrin-b3 receptor binding domain of the henipavirus g envelope glycoprotein is a potent cross-reactive neutralizing antibody in vitro. it was effective in protecting ferrets from lethal niv challenge (38) . in may 2010, in queensland, australia, m102.4 was offered as a trial on compassionate grounds to a mother and daughter who were exposed to hendra virus from their infected horse. both of them did not develop hendra virus infection, although it is still not known whether treatment was effective or whether the patients did not get infected. in an animal study comprised of 14 african green monkey (agm) subjects, m102.4 prevented infection and death after injection of a lethal dose of niv in 12 agm subjects. both the control agm subjects contracted severe infection and developed encephalitis as well as ards (39). the viral rna-dependent rna polymerase inhibitor favipiravir was developed by toyama chemical company as an antiviral for use against influenza. in a syrian hamster model for nipah virus infection, favipiravir was successfully used in lethally challenged hamsters (40). case fatality rates ranges from 40% to 100%. poor prognostic factors from the malaysian outbreak included old age, more severe brain-stem involvement presenting as a reduced level of consciousness, vomiting, abnormal doll's-eye reflex, abnormal pupils, hypertension, and tachycardia during the course of the illness (19) . the morbidity and mortality of healthcare workers involved in care of patients with niv is a major concern (13, 17, (41) (42) (43) (44) . although, there is still a lot of confusion about transmission and spread of this paramyxovirus, there is a need to lay guidelines for protection of the healthcare workforce based on present evidence and resources available. a leaf can be drawn from the successful containment of ebola and severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) outbreaks, which affected health care workers (hcws) (45). standard precautions, hand hygiene and personal protective equipment (ppe) remain as pillars of comprehensive infection prevention and control strategy (46, 47) . all hospitals should adhere to standard infection control precautions for all patient-care activities and aerosol-generating procedures. in case of niv infection in health-care settings, additional measures, such as droplet, contact and airborne precautions should be applied. droplet precautions rely on isolation (one-patient isolation rooms or cohorting [i.e., grouping patients infected with the same infectious agents together to confine their care to one area and prevent contact with susceptible patients]) and keeping the patient with an existing roommate. a patient that meets the criteria for a suspect nipah case should immediately be isolated and infection control precautions instituted. in general, hospitals in at-risk areas need to be prepared for the management of nipah cases via hospital screening, admission procedures and triage, and the management of visitor access and movement should be in place to minimize potential exposure. standard precautions should be applied while handling patients, handling the deceased, handling the specimens, cleaning and waste disposal. hand hygiene: handwashing with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub before and after patient contact. evidence from bangladesh suggested that nipah virus can survive on surfaces and be a potential source of spread of infection to caregivers (44) . lack of hand hygiene practices and scarcity of water in the setting was possibly responsible for hcws being affected in the outbreak (44) . the importance of hand hygiene cannot be over emphasized and it remains the crucial cornerstone for preventing spread of infection (44, 46, 48) . wearing of ppe when performing an aerosol generating procedure or a patient examination. highest level of protection (level b/a osha) is recommended for nipah. infections in hcws with sars or ebola during the respective outbreaks were very commonly attributed to improper ppe removal or doffing (49-52). nipah virus outbreak should be suspected in relevant epidemiological settings (e.g. history of travel or residence in known geographical areas with nipah transmission or contact with pigs or bats) in clusters of patients presenting with acute encephalitis with or without ards, high secondary attack rate and very high mortality. these patients should be managed with appropriate infection control measures. until the time when newer drugs are developed for its effective treatment, the role of drugs like ribavirin has to be clearly established with the help of properly designed trials. effective control measures in the community to prevent its transmission from animals (bats/pigs) to humans in disease prone areas have to be instituted. in the battle of virus vs. man, hopefully the latter will turn out to be victorious in the long run.

       "4  transmission of infectious diseases in indoor environment has been receiving more and more attentions. existing research shows that some infectious diseases such as sars, tuberculosis, influenza, etc. can all spread through air (yu et al. 2004; li et al. 2007) . humans produce droplets during expiratory activities such as coughing, talking, and sneezing. if these droplets are produced by an infected person, pathogenic contaminants can be transmitted to other people and lead to cross-infection. single room isolation with unidirectional, high efficiency particulate air filter (hepa) filtering airflow from the entire ceiling unit has been used to protect patients who need the most protection (yang et al. 2015) . in such clean wards, \"laminar\" (not in real sense) airflow moves in parallel and same direction with almost same velocity from the air supply opening to the air return opening (gregory et al. 2007) . such a unidirectional airflow ventilation system is believed to be able to control the particle/droplet or other contaminant cross transmission and can be removed effectively. some existing study indicated that unidirectional ventilation system combined with an appropriate air filtration system could greatly decrease the cross infection risk and increase patient survival rate effectively (storb et al. 1983 ; barnes and rogers 1989; passweg et al. 1998; schlesinger et al. 2009 ). as discussed in previous study, although the unidirectional ventilated protective isolation room (uvpir) is patient room in hospital, it has difference with airborne infection isolation room (aiir) and operating theatre (ot) (yang et al. 2015) . hence, the research findings in aiir and ot may not applicable in uvpir. laminar airflow system has been widely used in operating theatre to decrease rates of surgical site infections (ssi). in recent years, some scholars doubted the effect of laminar airflow on the reduction of wound infections. for example, gastmeir et al. (2012) investigated the influence of laminar airflow on the surgical site infections and concluded that it would be a waste of resources to establish new operating room with laminar airflow system. james et al. (2015) reviewed the current literature for the use of laminar airflow operating theatre ventilation during total joint arthroplasty and examined the effectiveness of laminar airflow on preventing post-operative wound infection and found that there is no conclusive effect on the reduction of post-operative wound infections by laminar airflow system. the vertical laminar airflow system directs air from ceiling to floor. the airflow passes over the head and upper body of the surgeon and assistants to the surgical site. during surgical procedures, bacteria-laden dust particles, textile fibers, and respiratory aerosols may be released from the surgical team in to the air of the operating room. these bacteria may be carried by the downward airflow to settle on the surgical instruments or directly enter the surgical site and lead to surgical site infection (james et al. 2015; mchugh et al. 2015) . the key reason that the vertical laminar airflow may lead to surgical site infection is that the bacteria sources (the head and upper body of the surgeon and assistant) located at the upper area of the patient. the relative positions of patient and doctors or nurses are different in uvpir and operating theatre. the vertical laminar airflow from the whole ceiling in the uvpir will create an entire protective environment for the patient from being infected from doctors or nurses who may enter into the ward. the bacteria from the doctors or nurses will be carried by the downward airflow to the floor level and removed from the exhaust opening located at the bottom of the two sidewalls. hence, using vertical laminar airflow system to decrease cross infection risk is more appropriate in uvpir than in operating theatre. a lot of related work on person to person droplets/ particles or contaminant cross transmission in different ventilation systems can be found in the literature. for example, chen et al. (2010) investigated the droplets/particles cross transmission between dental healthcare workers and patient. cao et al. (2015) examined the performance of protected zone ventilation and hybrid protected zone ventilation in reducing person to person airborne cross transmission in office room by experiment. habchi et al. (2014) studied the cross-infection between occupants in the room with a mathematical multi-plume multi-layer transport model. habchi et al. (2016) investigated the direct and indirect cross-contamination in office space with ceiling personalized ventilation combined with desk fans. he et al. (2011) investigated the exhaled droplet cross-transmission between occupants in a typical office room with different ventilation strategies. li et al. (2011) adopted a novel modeling approach to directly assess the inhalation dose of infectious droplets and estimated the exposure risk for the co-occupant under different ventilation methods. olmedo et al. (2013) investigated the risk of airborne cross-infection between the two breathing thermal manikins in a room with vertical low-velocity ventilation. nielsen et al. (2012) studied the cross transmission of the exhaled small particles between two people standing in surrounding with a vertical temperature gradient. most of these studies indicated the importance of using appropriate particle sizes in conducting this type of study. the issue is particularly important for uvpir where the patient may be exposed to various types of bio-aerosols generated from others. back in the 1940s, duguid (1946) studied the sizes of droplets from speaking, coughing and sneezing through microscopic measurement, and found that the range of the droplets diameters was from 1 μm to 2000 μm and 95% of the droplets were less than 100 μm. chao et al. (2009) measured the droplet size using the interferometric mie imaging (imi) technique. the droplet size distribution obtained by their study was more in line with the data obtained by duguid (1946) . the geometric mean diameter of the droplets expelled from coughing and speaking was 13.5 μm and 16.0 μm, respectively from their study. the droplet concentrations were range from 0.004 to 0.223 cm −3 for speaking and 2.4-5.2 cm −3 per cough for coughing. the average number of droplets/particles emitted each sneeze and cough was 1 × 10 6 and 5 × 10 3 , respectively. larger droplets may settle out of the airflow quickly and thus the cross transmission only happens when the individuals are close enough. smaller droplets may hang in the air for longer time and spread for longer distance, thus will have higher risk of cross transmission between person to person (riley 1974; brachman 1990 ). overall, existing research showed that the droplets of different sizes have different dispersion characteristics and cross transmission risk. previously, we have developed a computational model to simulate the airflow and contaminant dispersion in uvpir (yang et al. 2015) . however, air contaminant generated from human source was overly simplified as gaseous in that study. the goal of this study is to further understand the droplets dispersion characteristics and cross transmission risk with different sizes in unidirectional ventilated protective isolation room. in our previous study, cfd software (fluent 2005) was used to simulate the airflow and gaseous contaminant concentration in uvpir. rng k-ε turbulence model was selected to simulate the airflow field in uvpir. the simulation model was validated against experimental data (yang et al. 2015) . built upon this airflow model, we intend to simulate the dispersion process of the droplets with the following three initial sizes: large (100 μm), medium (10 μm), and small (represented by gaseous contaminant). particles smaller than 2 μm were found to share the common dispersion and transport properties of air (chen et al. 2006) . it is feasible to simulate the smaller particle with species transport model, but not for larger particles concerned in this study. each droplet released from manikin's mouth was tracked individually in a lagrangian frame for its instantaneous position, velocity and other parameters. generally for the particles observed in indoor air, other forces such as the basset history, the pressure gradient and the virtual mass are negligible compared with the drag force (zhao et al. 2004 ). the density and size of the droplets investigated in this study are all similar with their study, hence, the basset force, the pressure gradient force and the virtual mass force are ignored in our simulation. the stokes drag force, the saffman's lift force, thermophoretic force and gravitational force were considered in this study. thus, the lagrangian equations describing the motion of the droplets are p p d d the droplet characteristic time in eq. (2) is defined as the cunningham slip correction factor c c for small size droplets in eq. (4) is ρ p is the density of the droplet, d p is the diameter of the droplet, λ is the mean free path. the gradient of diffusion due to the vapor pressure equilibrium at the droplet's surface is used to calculate the vaporization rate of the droplets: where nu aw is the nusselt correlation at the air-water interface. d m is the mass diffusion coefficient. c in eqs. (6) and (7) is the mass transfer coefficient; the value of c is calculated from a nusselt correlation (ranz and marshall 1952) . sc is the schmidt number. r is the universal gas constant. p sat (t p ) is the saturated water vapor pressure. t p is the temperature of the droplets. x i is the local bulk mole fraction of water vapor, p op is the operating pressure, and t ¥ is the local bulk temperature in the air. heat balance equation is used to simulate the droplet temperature. it is the sensible heat change in the droplet to the latent heat of evaporation and the convective heat transfer between the droplet and the air: where m p is the mass of droplet, c p is the specific heat capacity of droplet, h fg is the latent heat of evaporation. h is the heat transfer coefficient, and is obtained in similar way: where κ eff is the effective thermal conductivity, pr is prandtl number. the airflow turbulence model and gaseous contaminant simulation model have been validated previously (yang et al. 2015) . we only need to validate the droplet simulation model here. chao and wan (2006) tested the dispersion of expiratory aerosols in unidirectional downward ventilation room with dimensions of 4.8 m × 4.8 m × 2.6 m (width × length × height). the tested ventilation type is quite similar to unidirectional ventilated protective isolation room investigated in this study. the droplet emission source was located at the center of the testing room, 0.8 m above the floor. droplets were emitted vertically upward. we simulated their experimental cases with the simulation model discussed above and compared with the data. figure 1 indicates that the predicted vertical position trajectory of droplets matches well with the experiment results. we simulated the droplets cross transmission between two manikins in uvpir in this study. the size of the room is 3 m × 2.5 m × 3 m (width-x, height-y, and length-z). clean air is supplied into the room through ceiling-mounted hepa filters with the opening size of 3 m × 3 m (width-x and length-z). the air is exhausted from the outlets located on the bottom of two sidewalls of the room, with each opening size being 0.3 m × 3 m (height-y, and width-x). two standing manikins with 1.0 m apart are located in the room, as shown in fig. 2 . the blue manikin represents the susceptible and the red manikin represents the source. the heights of both manikins are 1.7 m. wells (1934) defined large droplets as those over 100 μm in aerodynamic diameter. hence, 100 μm is selected in this study to investigate the transmission characteristics of large fig. 2 the schematic of the simulated room and manikins droplets. lindsley et al. (2010) measured the influenza virus in aerosol particles from human coughs and found that not only that coughing by patients emitted aerosols containing the influenza virus, but also that much of the influenza viral was contained within particles in the respirable size range. 35% of the detected influenza rna was contained in particles >4 μm, 23% in particles of 1-4 μm, and 42% in particles <1 μm. 10 μm is selected in this study to examine the transmission characteristics of medium droplets. gaseous contaminant is also studied to represent small droplets (smaller than 1 μm) and chemical contaminant. velocity inlet boundary condition was used for the inlet opening, the supply air velocity was 0.25 m/s which was recommended by yang et al. (2015) and the supply air temperature was set to 24 °c. the mass flow rate at outlet was equal to that of inlet. the heat fluxes of room enclosure surfaces were all set to 0. the body surface temperature of the manikins was set to 33 °c (yang et al. 2015) . based on the research of mcfadden et al. (1985) , the temperature of coughing air from source manikin's mouth and the breathing air from both source and susceptible manikins' noses were set to 32 °c. the flow boundary conditions at the mouth and nose of the source manikin were different depending on whether he/she was breathing or coughing. in our simulation, the coughing airflow came from source manikin's mouth; the airflow from source manikin's nose was 0 during coughing. after coughing, the source manikin breathed with nose and the airflow rate from mouth was 0. the susceptible manikin breathed with nose during all simulating time and the airflow rate from his/her mouth was 0. the boundary conditions of the exhalation at source manikin and susceptible manikin's fig. 1 the comparison of the predicted vertical position of the droplets with the experimental data by chao and wan (2006) mouth and nose were specified according to the study of gupta et al. (2009 gupta et al. ( , 2010 . droplets were composed of organic ions, aqueous solution containing inorganic and glycoproteins. the relative humidity has great influence on the dispersion of the droplets in the room. low relative humidity results in rapid evaporation and thus leads to the increase of the suspended particles in the room air (arundel et al. 1986 ). the relative humidity (rh) in the supply air was set to 50%, as recommended by the chinese standard gb 50457-2008 (2009) . the relative humidity of the breathing and coughing air was set to 100%. when expelled from source manikin's mouth, the droplets entered into an environment that had a lower temperature and relative humidity than that in the coughing air. the detailed settings of boundary conditions are shown in table 1 . the airflow field in the simulated uvpir is shown in fig. 3 . the stream lines are almost parallel above the manikins' heads. the downward airflow directions are changed by the thermal plume from manikin and created two \"human thermal plume affecting zones\" (htpa zones), which is defined as the vortex area affected by the human thermal plume (yang et al. 2014) . the downward airflow near the manikin is pulled up by the manikin thermal plume and creates a vortex airflow around the human body. the existence of the htpa zone has mixed effects. on one hand, the htpa zone around the manikin can create a protective barrier and prevent the contaminant from entering the zone fig. 3 the airflow field in the uvpir and avoid contaminant cross transmission. on the other hand, if the contaminants are entrained into the htpa zone, the upward airflow in the zone will carry the contaminant to the manikin's breathing zone and lead to cross transmission. the effective way to decrease cross transmission is to prevent contaminants from entering the htpa zone of the susceptible manikin. the dispersion process of the droplets with initial diameter of 100 μm from coughing is shown in fig. 4 . these droplets carried by the coughing jet can move forward for a very short distance (less than 0.3 m) before going downward, and mainly disperse in the htpa zone of the source manikin after that. the droplets settle out of the coughing jet quickly after emitted from source manikin's mouth. very few droplets remain in the uvpir one minute after. figure 5 shows the dispersion process of the droplets with initial diameter of 10 μm. approximate 60% of the droplets carried by the coughing jet move forward for approximately 0.6 m, enter into and disperse in the htpa zone of the susceptible manikin. the other parts of droplets (approximate 40%) remain in the htpa zone of the source manikin and mainly disperse around the source manikin area. as shown in table 1 , the peak coughing velocity can reach 9 m/s. such high velocity coughing jet can easily break out the protective barrier and enter into the htpa zone of susceptible manikin. however, after coughing, the source manikin respires via nose. the peak breathing velocity drops down to 2.9 m/s. during the respiration process, the breathing air cannot break out the protective barrier and enter the htpa zone of the susceptible as shown in fig. 5 . hence, when the velocity of the coughing airflow is higher (much higher than 2.9 m/s), the droplets can be carried by the high fig. 4 the dispersion process of droplets with initial diameter of 100 μm velocity coughing jet to the susceptible manikin's htpa zone. but when the velocity of the coughing airflow is lower, the droplets cannot reach the susceptible manikin's htpa zone. one minute after, most of the droplets are removed from the room. the dispersion process of the gaseous droplets is shown in fig. 6 . similar to the dispersion process of the droplets with initial diameter of 10 μm, part of the gaseous contaminants are carried by the higher velocity coughing jet to a longer distance in 3 seconds and enter the htpa zone of the susceptible manikin directly. other gaseous contaminants carried by the lower velocity coughing airflow remain in the htpa zone of the source manikin. five seconds after, the two parts of gaseous contaminants are dispersed in the htpa zones of susceptible and source manikins respectively. the gaseous contaminant concentrations in the area close to the body of two manikins are higher than that of other places. the contaminant is diluted gradually with time. fig. 5 the dispersion process of droplets with initial diameter of 10 μm fig. 6 the dispersion process of gaseous droplets one minute after, the contaminant concentration near the manikin is already diluted by 10 000 times. the dispersion processes of the droplets with initial diameter of 10 μm and gaseous contaminant are similar from the comparison between figs. 5 and 6. figure 7 shows how the droplet sizes change with time for different initial size droplets. for the droplets with initial size of 10 μm, the size remains nearly the same in the first 2 seconds due to high relative humidity of the breathing air, and then decreases rapidly to 2.6 μm in the following 0.4 seconds. the droplets with initial size of 10 μm become droplet nuclei with size of 2.6 μm rapidly after entering into the room. zhao and wu (2005) proposed an indicator to judge whether the particle can be treated as passive transport or gaseous contaminant. by calculating, we found when the particle size is less than 10 μm, the indicators of the droplets/particles in uvpir under 0.25 m/s air supply velocity are all lower than the upper limit (2.8e−02 s 2 ) suggested by zhao and wu (2005) . based on this, if the size of the droplet nuclei is less than 10 μm (which corresponds to 30 μm initial size of the droplet from fig. 7) , the droplet dispersion would be similar to that of gaseous contaminant. the droplets with initial size of 100 μm need 6 seconds to become the droplets nuclei with the size of 26 μm. for larger particles, the dispersion characteristics are of great difference than gaseous contaminant. figure 8 shows the total quantity of droplets changing with time in the uvpir. for the droplets with initial size of 100 μm and 10 μm, only 1% left in the room air after one minute. but for the gaseous contaminant, 15% of the contaminant left in the room air after one minute. although the droplets with initial size of 10 μm and the gaseous contaminant have similar dispersion process in the uvpir, their total quantities in the room air decay process are different. the reason is that the droplets deposit on the surfaces in the room during the transmission, not the gaseous contaminant. the quantity of the droplets with initial size of 100 μm has a rapid decrease in the first 5 seconds. the reason is that the droplets mainly disperse around the source manikin body surface in the first 10 seconds (as shown in fig. 4) , which leads to a great chance of settling and over 10% of the droplets deposit onto the body surface. the quantity of the droplets with initial size of 10 μm also has obvious decay at the first 15 seconds, but both the amount and the rate of decay are much smaller than that of the droplets with initial size of 100 μm. for the decay process of the gaseous contaminant, the quantity of the gaseous contaminant remains unchanged at the first 10 seconds and decreases gradually after that. the total amount of the gaseous contaminant drops to 20% in 30 seconds, and the decay rate becomes quite small after that. one minute after, 15% of the gaseous contaminant remains in the room. the schematic diagram of the dispersion process of the droplets in the uvpir is summarized in fig. 9 . from the discussions above, large droplets have larger settling velocity, so that the droplets settle out of the coughing jet quickly after coming out from mouth and cannot be carried by the coughing jet to the htpa zone of the susceptible manikin. hence, the larger droplets disperse mainly in the htpa zone of the source manikin, and the droplets cross transmission between source manikin and susceptible manikin should be very small. but for small droplets/gaseous contaminants, part of them are carried by the higher velocity coughing fig. 7 the size change with time of the droplets with different initial sizes fig. 8 the total quantity of droplets change with time in the uvpir fig. 9 the schematic diagram of the dispersion process of the droplets in the uvpir jet to the htpa zone of the susceptible manikin and lead to cross transmission. the remaining contaminants carried by the lower velocity coughing jet remain in the htpa zone of the source manikin. this indicates that a potential effective measure to reduce person to person cross transmission in uvpir is to decrease the velocity of coughing jet like wearing a mask. we simulated the dispersion process of the droplets with initial diameter of 100 μm and 10 μm and gaseous contaminant in a uvpir and studied the droplets dispersion characteristics and cross transmission with different sizes. we can get the following conclusions: (1) for the droplets with initial size of 100 μm, the droplets settle out of the coughing jet quickly and cannot be carried by the coughing jet to the htpa zone of the susceptible manikin. almost all the droplets are left in the source manikin's htpa zone and dispersion in it. (2) the droplets with initial size of 10 μm and gaseous contaminant have similar dispersion process but different decay process in the uvpir. (3) part of the small droplets and gaseous contaminant that are carried by the higher velocity coughing airflow can enter the htpa zone of the susceptible manikin and disperse around it. the other part cannot spread to the susceptible manikin's htpa zone and mainly spread in the source manikin's htpa zone.   \n",
